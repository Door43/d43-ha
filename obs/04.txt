Many years after the flood, there were again many people in the world, and they all spoke the same language. Instead of filling the earth as God had commanded, they gathered together and built a city.

Shekaru dayawa bayan ambaliyar ruwa, mutane sun riɓanɓanya a duniya, suna kuwa magana cikin harshe guda. Ba su je suka cika duniya ba, amma sun tsaya wuri guda sun gina birni.

They were very proud, and they did not care about what God said. They even began building a tall tower to reach heaven. God saw that if they all kept working together to do evil, they could do many more sinful things.

Sun cika da farha, ba su kula da zancen Allah ba. Sai suka fara gina doguwar hasumiya don su kai sama. Allah ya gani idan dai sun ci gaba da taraya cikin yin mugunta, za su lalace cikin zunubensu.

So God changed their language into many different languages and spread the people out all over the world. The city they had begun to build was called Babel, which means, "confused."

Sai Allah ya dagula harshensu cikin harsuna daban-daban, Ya kuma warwatsa su ko'ina cikin duniya. Birnin da suka fara ginawa sunansa Babila, ma'ana "ruɗani".

Hundreds of years later, God spoke to a man named Abram. God told him, "Leave your country and family and go to the land I will show you. I will bless you and make you a great nation. I will make your name great. I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you. All families on earth will be blessed because of you."

Shekaru ɗaruruwa suka wuce, Allah yayi magana da wani mutun mai suna Abram. Allah ya ce masa:"ka fita daga ƙasarka da danginka, ka je wata ƙasa da zan numa maka. Zan albarkace ka in kuma maishe ka al'umma mai girma. Zan albarkaci waɗanda suka albarkace ka, amma zan la'anta waɗanda suka la;antaka. Dukan al'umman duniya za su samu albarka sabili da kai.

So Abram obeyed God. He took his wife, Sarai, together with all of his servants and everything he owned and went to the land God showed him, the land of Canaan.

Sai Abram yayi biyyaya ga Allah. Ya ɗauki matarsa Saraya, tare da dukan barorinsa da dukan mallakarsu, ya tafi ƙasar da Allah ya gwada masa, ƙasar Kana'ana.

When Abram arrived in Canaan, God said, "Look all around you. I will give to you and your descendants all the land that you can see as an inheritance." Then Abram settled in the land.

Da Abram ya iso ƙasar Kana'ana sai Allah ya ce:" Duba kewaye da kai. Zan baka, kai da zuriyarka dukan ƙasar da kake gani gado". Sai Abram ya zauna cikin ƙasar.

One day, Abram met Melchizedek, the priest of God Most High. Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, "May God Most High who owns heaven and earth bless Abram." Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all he owned.

Wata rana Abram ya gamu da Malkisadik, firist na Allah Maɗaukaki.Malkisadik ya albarkaci Abram ya ce:" Bari Allah Maɗaukaki wanda ya yi sama da ƙasa ya sa wa Abram albarka". Sai Abram ya ba Malkisadik zaaka na dukan dukiyarsa.

Many years went by, but Abram and Sarai still did not have a son. God spoke to Abram and promised again that he would have a son and as many descendants as the stars in the sky. Abram believed God's promise. God declared that Abram was righteous because he believed in God's promise.

Shekaru da dama sun wuce amma Abram da Saraya ba su haifu ba.Allah yayi magana da Abram yayi masa alkawalin samun ɗa da zuriyar mai yawa kamar taurarin sama. Abram ya gaskanta da wannan alkawali. Allah kuwa ya lasafta wannan adalci ne a gare shi.

Then God made a covenant with Abram. A covenant is an agreement between two parties. God said, "I will give you a son from your own body. I give the land of Canaan to your descendants." But Abram still did not have a son.

//A Bible story from: Genesis 11-15//

//Sai Allah ya ɗauki ƙuduri da Abram. Ƙuduri sharaɗi ne tsakanin sashe biyu. Allah ya ce:"zan baka ɗa daga cikinka. Na ba zuriyarka ƙasar kana'ana". Amma Abram bai haifu ba tukuna.//
