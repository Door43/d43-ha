Ten years after Abram and Sarai arrived in Canaan, they still did not have a child. So Abram's wife, Sarai, said to him, "Since God has not allowed me to have children and now I am too old to have children, here is my servant, Hagar. Marry her also so she can have a child for me."

Shekara goma bayan da Abram da Saraya suka iso Kana'ana, ba su dai haifu ba tukuna. Sai Saraya ta cewa Abram:" tunda Allah bai yarda mani in samu ya'ya ba, kuma yanzu na tsufa ƙwarai domin haifuwa, to ga baranya ta Hajaratu. Aure ta domin ta haifa mana ɗa."

So Abram married Hagar. Hagar had a baby boy, and Abram named him Ishmael. But Sarai became jealous of Hagar. When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again spoke to Abram.

Sai Abram ya auri Hajaratu. Hajaratu ta haifi ɗa namiji, Abram ya kira sunansa Isma'ilu. Amma Saraya ta cika da kishin Hajaratu. Da Isma'ilu ya kai shekara goma sha uku, Allah ya sake magana da Abram.

God said, "I am God Almighty. I will make a covenant with you." Then Abram bowed to the ground. God also told Abram, "You will be the father of many nations. I will give you and your descendants the land of Canaan as their possession and I will be their God forever. You must circumcise every male in your family."

Allah ya ce:"Ni ne Allah mai iko dukka. Zan yi alkawali da kai". Sai Abram ya rusuna ƙasa. Allah ya ƙara cewa Abram:" Za ka zama uban al'ummai dayawa. Zan baka, kai da zuriyarka ƙasar Kana'ana gado, Zan zama Allahnsu har abada. Sai ku yi wa kowane ɗa namiji kaciya.

"Your wife, Sarai, will have a son—he will be the son of promise. Name him Isaac. I will make my covenant with him, and he will become a great nation. I will make Ishmael a great nation, too, but my covenant will be with Isaac." Then God changed Abram's name to Abraham, which means "father of many." God also changed Sarai's name to Sarah, which means "princess."

"Matarka Saraya za ta haifi ɗa- Zai zama ɗan alkawali. Raɗa mashi suna Ishaku. Zan yi alkawali da shi, zai zama babbar al'umma. Zan sa Isma'ilu shi zama babbar al'umma shima, amma alkawalina da Ishaƙu ne." Sai Allah ya canza sunan Abram, ya kira shi Ibrahim wato ma'ana "uban dayawa". Allah ya kuma canza sunan Saraya ya kirata Saratu,wato ma'ana ƴar sarki.

That day Abraham circumcised all the males in his household. About a year later, when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's son. They named him Isaac as God had told them to do.

Wannan rana Ibrahim ya yi wa duk ƴaƴa maza kaciya a gidansa. Kusan shekara guda bayan wannan, lokacin da Ibrahim ya kai shekara ɗari, Saratu shekara tasa'in, Saratu ta haifa ma Ibrahim ɗa. Sun kira shi Ishaƙu kamar yadda Allah ya faɗɗamasu.

When Isaac was a young man, God tested Abraham's faith by saying, "Take Isaac, your only son, and kill him as a sacrifice to me." Again Abraham obeyed God and prepared to sacrifice his son.

Da Ishaƙu ya zama saurayi, Allah ya jaraba bangaskiyar Ibrahim cewa:" Ɗauki Ishaƙu, ɗanka makaɗaici, ka miƙa shi hadaya a garaini." Kuma Ibrahim yayi biyyaya ga Allah, sai ya shirya ya bada ɗansa hadaya.

As Abraham and Isaac walked to the place of sacrifice, Isaac asked, "Father, we have wood for the sacrifice, but where is the lamb?" Abraham replied, "God will provide the lamb for the sacrifice, my son."

Lokacin da Ibrahim da Ishaƙu suka zo wurin hadaya, Ishaƙu yayi tambaya:" Baba, muna da itace don hadaya, amma ina ragon?" Ibrahim ya amsa: " Allah zai tanada wa kansa ragon hadaya, ɗana".

When they reached the place of sacrifice, Abraham tied up his son Isaac and laid him on an altar. He was about to kill his son when God said, "Stop! Do not hurt the boy! Now I know that you fear me because you did not keep your only son from me."

Da suka kawo wurin hadaya, Ibrahim ya ɗaure ɗansa Ishaƙu, ya ɗora shi bisan bagadi. Yana shirin kashe shi sai Allah yayi magana:"

Dakata! Kar ka yanka shi! Yanzu na sani kana tsorona, da yake ba ka ƙi ka bani ɗanka, tilonka".

Nearby Abraham saw a ram that was stuck in a bush. God had provided the ram to be the sacrifice instead of Isaac. Abraham happily offered the ram as a sacrifice.

Kusansu Ibrahim ya ga rago cikin kurmi.Allah ya tanada wannan rago don hadaya maimakon Ishaƙu. Ibrahim yayi hamzari ya miƙa ragon hadaya.

Then God said to Abraham, "Because you were willing to give me everything, even your only son, I promise to bless you. Your descendants will be more than the stars in the sky. Because you have obeyed me, all the families of the world will be blessed through your family."

//A Bible story from: Genesis 16-22//

//Sai Allah ya cewa Ibrahim:" Domin kana da himma ka bani komi, har da ɗanka tilonka, Na yi alkawari in albarkace ka. Zuriyarka za su wuce taurarin sama. Domin ka yi biyyaya da ni, dukkan iyalai duniya za su sami albarka ta wurin iyalinka."//
