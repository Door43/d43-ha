In the past, God had spoken to his people through his angels and prophets. But then 400 years went by when he did not speak to them. Suddenly an angel came with a message from God to an old priest named Zechariah. Zechariah and his wife, Elizabeth, were godly people, but she had not been able to have any children.

A zamanin da Allah ya yi magana da mutanensa ta wurin mala'iku da annabawa. Amma shekaru 400 suka wuce bai yi magana ba. Ba zato ba tsammani wani mala'ika ya zo da saƙo daga Allah zuwa wani tsofon firist mai suna Zakariya. Zakariya da matarshi Alisabatu, mutanen Allah ne, amma ba ta samu sa'ar haifuwa ba tukuna.

The angel said to Zechariah, "Your wife will have a son. You will name him John. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and will prepare the people for the Messiah!" Zechariah responded, "My wife and I are too old to have children! How will I know this will happen?"

Mala'ikan ya cewa Zakariya :" matarka za ta haifi ɗa. Za ka raɗa masa sunan Yahaya. Zai cika da Ruhu Mai Tsarki, kuma zai shirya mutanen domin Almasihu!" Zakariya ya amsa:" Matata da ni, mun tsufa da yawa domin haifuwar ƴaƴa! Ƙaƙa zan sani wannan zai faru?"

The angel responded to Zechariah, "I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born." Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah returned home and his wife became pregnant.

Mala'ikan ya amsawa Zakariya:" Allah ya aiko ni in kawo maku labari mai daɗi. Domin ba ka gaskanta ba, ba za ka yi magana ba har sai  an haifi ɗan". Nan da nan sai Zakariya ya bebance. Sai mala'kan ya bar Zakariya. Bayan haka, Zakariya ya koma gidansa, kuma mata tasa ta ɗauki ciki.

When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel suddenly appeared to Elizabeth's relative, whose name was Mary. She was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph. The angel said, "You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him Jesus. He will be the Son of the Most High God and will rule forever."

Lokacin da Alisabatu tana da cikin wata shidda, wannan mala'ikan, ba zato ba tsammani ya sake bayyanuwa ga ƴar uwar Alisabatu mai suna Maryamu. Budurwa ce, kuma wani saurayi mai sunan Yusufu yana tashenta. Mala'ikan ya ce:" Za ki yi ciki, kuma za ki haifi ɗa. Za ki kira sunansa Yesu. Zai zama Ɗan Allah Maɗaukaki, kuma zai yi mulki har abada".

Mary replied, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?" The angel explained, "The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will overshadow you. So the baby will be holy, the Son of God." Mary believed and accepted what the angel said.

Maryamu ta amsa ta ce:" Yaya wannan zai yi faru tunda yake ni budurwa ce?" Mala'ikan ya kwatamta mata cewa:" Ruhu Mai Tsarki zai sauko miki, kuma ikon Allah zai lulluɓe ki. Jaririn zai zama mai tsarki, Ɗan Allah." Maryamu ta gaskanta, ta kuma yarda da abin da mala'ika ya faɗa.

Soon after the angel spoke to Mary, she went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, Elizabeth's baby jumped inside her. The women rejoice d together about what God had done for them. After Mary visited Elizabeth for three months, Mary returned home.

Dan lokaci kaɗan bayan da mala'ikan ya yi magana da Maryamu, sai ta ziyarci Alisabatu. Da Alisabatu ta ji gaisuwar Maryamu sai ɗan cikin Alisabatu ya motsa da ƙarfi a ciki. Matan sun yi murna tare domin abin da Allah ya yi masu. Bayan da Maryamu ta yi ziyarar wata uku gidan Alisabatu, sai ta koma gida.

After Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy, Zechariah and Elizabeth named the baby John, as the angel had commanded. Then God allowed Zechariah to speak again. Zechariah said, “Praise God, because he has remembered his people! You, my son, will be called the prophet of the Most High God who will tell the people how they can receive forgiveness for their sins!”

//A Bible story from: Luke 1//

//Bayan da Alisabatu ta haifi ɗa namiji, Zakariya da Alisabatu suka raɗa masa suna Yahaya kamar yadda mala'ikan ya umurce su. Sai Allah ya ba Zakariya damar saka yin magana kuma. ZAkariya ya ce:" Yabo ga Allah domin ya tuna da mutanensa! Kai ɗana, za a kira ka annabin Allah Maɗaukaki, wandai zai faɗawa mutane ƙaƙa za su sami gafarar zunubensu!"//
