Adam and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden God had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but this did not cause them to feel any shame, because there was no sin in the world. They often walked in the garden and talked with God.

Adamu da matarsa suna jin daɗin rayuwa a cikin gonar inda Allah ya sa su. Dukansu biyu a tsiraice suke, ba su kuwa ji kunya ba domin babu zunubi a cikin duniya. Su kan yi tafiya cikin gonar, suna kuwa magana da Allah.

But there was a crafty snake in the garden. He asked the woman, "Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?"

Amma akwai maciji mai wayo a cikin gonar. Ya tambayi macen:"Ko Allah ya ce ba za ku ci daga ya'yen itacen cikin gonar ba?"

The woman answered, "God told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told us, 'If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will die.'"

Macen ta amsa ta ce:"Allah ya ce muna iya cin dukan ya'yen itace banda ya'yen icce sanin nagarta da mugunta. Allah ya ce mana " Idan kun ci ya'yen iccen nan, ko kuka taɓa shi, za ku mutu."

The snake responded to the woman, "That is not true! You will not die. God just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be like God and will understand good and evil like he does."

Macijin ya cewa macen:" Ba gaskiya bane! Ba za ku mutu ba. Allah ya san da in kun ci za ku zama kamar Allah, za ku kuma san nagarta da mugunta kamar yadda ya sani".

The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be wise, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too.

Macen ta gani ya'yen iccen yana da kyau, zai yi daɗin ci, sai ta cira ta ci. Sai ta baiwa mijinta, da yake tare da ita, shima ya ci.

Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They tried to cover their bodies by sewing leaves together to make clothes.

Nan da nan sai idanunsu suka buɗe, sai suka gane tsirara suke. Sai suka samo ganyayen ɓaure suka yi wa kansu sutura.

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of God walking through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, "Where are you?" Adam replied, "I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid."

Mutumen da matarsa suka ji motsin Allah yana yawo a gonar, sai suka ɓoye wa Allah. Amma Allah ya kira mutumen:" Ina kake?" Adamu ya amsa:"Na ji motsinka cikin gonar, na ji tsoro domin tsirara nake, na kuwa ɓuya".

Then God asked, "Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?" The man answered, "You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit." Then God asked the woman, "What have you done?" The woman replied, "The snake tricked me."

Sai Allah ya tambaye shi:" Wa ya faɗa maka tsirara kake? Ko ka ci daga ya'yen iccen da na ce kar ka ci? Mutumen ya amsa:"Macen da ka bani itace ta bani na ci". Sai Allah ya tambayi macen:" Me kika yi haka?" Macen ta amsa ta ce:" Macijin ne ya yaudareni".

God said to the snake, "You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The woman's descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel."

Allah ya cewa macijin:"Ka zama la'ananne! za ka yi rarrafe, za ka ci turɓaya. Zan sa ƙiyyaya tsakanin kai da macen, ya'yenka da ya'yenta kuma za su yi ƙiyyaya. Zuriyar macen za ta ƙuje kanka, kai kuma za ka ƙuje diddigensa.

God then said to the woman, "I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you."

Allah ya cewa macen:" Zan tsanenta naƙudarki ainun; muradinki zai koma ga mijinki, zai kuwa mallakeki."

God said to the man, "You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will die, and your body will return to dirt." The man named his wife Eve, which means "life-giver," because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.

Allah ya cewa mutumen:" Ka kasa kunne ga matarka ka tayar mani. Yanzu ƙasa ta la'antu, da wahala za ka yi aiki ka samu cimaka. Za ka mutu, jikinka kuma zai koma turɓaya". Mutumen ya sa wa matar suna Hawa'u, wato mai bada rai, gama za ta zama uwar dukan mutane. Sai Allah ya yi wa Adamu da Hawa'u sutura da fatar dabbobi.

Then God said, "Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever." So God sent Adam and Eve away from the beautiful garden. God placed powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.

Sai Allah ya ce:"Yanzu mutane sun zama kamar mu, sun san nagarta da mugunta,bai kyautu ba su ci kuma ya'yen icce na rai, su rayu har abada". Allah ya kori Adamu da Hawa'u daga gonar Aidan. Allah ya kafa kerubobi da kuma takobi mai harshen wuta wanda yake jujjuyawa ko'ina don su tsare hanya zuwa itacen rai.
