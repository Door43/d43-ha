Saul was the first king of Israel. He was tall and handsome, just like the people wanted. Saul was a good king for the first few years that he ruled over Israel. But then he became a wicked man who did not obey God, so God chose a different man who would one day be king in his place.

Saul ne sarki na fari a Isra'ila. Yana da tsawo, kuma kyaukyawa ne, kamar yadda mutanen suke so. Saul ya zama sarki kirki ƴan shekaru na fari. Amma sai ya koma mai mugunta, mai rashin biyyaya ga Allah.. Sai Allah ya zaɓi wani mutun daban, wanda wata rana zai zama sarki maimakon shi.

God chose a young Israelite named David to be king after Saul. David was a shepherd from the town of Bethlehem. At different times while he was watching his father's sheep, David had killed both a lion and a bear that had attacked the sheep. David was a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

Allah ya zaɓi saurayi bayahude mai sunan Dauda ya zama sarki bayan Saul. Dauda makiyayi ne daga Betalami. A lokaci daban-daban, sa'ada yake kula da garken ubansa, Dauda ya kashe zaki da bear da suka faɗa wa ragunansa. Dauda mai tawali'u ne kuma mai adalci ne, yana tsoron Allah, yana kuma yi masa biyyaya.

David became a great soldier and leader. When David was still a young man, he fought against a giant named Goliath. Goliath was a trained soldier, very strong, and almost three meters tall! But God helped David kill Goliath and save Israel. After that, David won many victories over Israel's enemies, for which the people praised him.

Saul became jealous of the people's love for David. Saul tried many times to kill him, so David hid from Saul. One day, Saul was looking for David so he could kill him. Saul went into the same cave where David was hiding from Saul, but Saul did not see him. David was now very close to Saul and could have killed him, but he did not. Instead, David cut off a piece of Saul's clothes to prove to Saul that he would not kill him in order to become king.

Saul ya cika da kishi domin mutane su fi ƙaunar Dauda. Saul ya nema sau dayawa ya kashe shi, sai Dauda ya ɓoye ma Saul. Wata rana, Saul yana neman Dauda don ya kashe shi, Saul ya je cikin kogon dutsen inda Dauda ya boƴe, amma Saul bai gane shi ba. Dauda yana kusa da Saul, yana kuma iya kashe shi amma bai yi ba. Maimakon haka, Dauda ya yanke ƙaɗan daga rigar Saul domin Saul ya sani Dauda ba zai kashe shi ba don ya zama sarki.

Eventually, Saul died in battle, and David became king of Israel. He was a good king, and the people loved him. God blessed David and made him successful. David fought many battles and God helped him defeat Israel's enemies. David conquered Jerusalem and made it his capital city. During David's reign, Israel became powerful and wealthy.

Sai wata rana, Saul ya mutu cikin yaƙi, kuma Dauda ya zama sarkin Isra'ila. Sarki ne mai kirki, kuma mutane suna ƙaunarsa. Allah ya albarkace shi, kuma ya ba shi nasara cikin komi. Dauda ya yi yaƙi dayawa, kuma Allah ya taimake shi ya yi nasara da abokan gaban Isra'ila.

David wanted to build a temple where all the Israelites could worship God and offer him sacrifices. For about 400 years, the people had been worshiping God and offering sacrifices to him at the Tent of Meeting that Moses had built.

Dauda ya yi niya ya gina haikali inda dukan Isra'ilawa ke iya sujada ga Allah su kuma miƙa masa hadayu. Shekaru 400 da suka wuce, mutanen suna sujadarsu da hadayu ga Allah cikin alfarwar da Musa ya kafa.

But God sent the prophet Nathan to David with this message, "Because you are a man of war, you will not build this Temple for me. Your son will build it. But, I will bless you greatly. O<font 12.49px/arial;;rgb(0, 0, 0);;rgb(255, 255, 255)>ne of your descendants</font>    will rule as king over my people forever!" The only descendant of David who could rule forever was the Messiah." The Messiah was God's Chosen One who would save the people of the world from their sin.

Amma Allah ya aike da annabi Natan wurin Dauda da wannan saƙo:" Domin kai mutumen yaƙi ne, ba za ka gina haikalin ba domina. Ɗanka ne zai gina shi. Amma zan sa maka albarka sarai. Ɗaya daga zuriyarka zai yi mulkin mutanena har abada!" Makaɗaicin zuriyar Dauda wanda ke iya mulki har abada Al'masihu ne". Al'masihu zaɓaɓɓe ne na Allah, shi ne mai ceton mutanen duniya daga zunubensu.

When David heard these words, he immediately thanked and praised God because he had promised David this great honor and many blessings. David did not know when God would do these things. But as it happened, the Israelites would have to wait a long time before the Messiah came, almost 1,000 years.

Da Dauda ya ji waɗannan maganganu, sai nan da nan ya yabi Allah domin ya yi masa wannan babban alkawali da daraja da albarku. Dauda bai sani ba randa Allah zai cika waɗannan abu. Kamar yadda ya faru, Isra'ilawa sai sun yi jira lokaci mai tsawo kafin Al'masihu ya zo, kusan shekara 1000.

David ruled with justice and faithfulness for many years, and God blessed him. However, toward the end of his life he sinned terribly against God.

Dauda ya yi mulki da adalci da bangaskiya shekaru dayawa, kuma Allah ya albarkace shi. Duk da wannan, kusan ƙarshen rayuwarshi, ya yi wa Allah babban zunubi.

One day, when all of David's soldiers were away from home fighting battles, he looked out from his palace and saw a beautiful woman bathing. Her name was Bathsheba.

Wata rana, sa'adda dukan sojojin Dauda suke daji cikin yaƙi, ya leƙa daga gidansa, sai ya ga mace kyaukyawa tana wanka. Sunanta Bat-sheba.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-17-11.jpg?direct&}}

Instead of looking away, David sent someone to bring her to him. He slept with her and sent her back home. A short time later Bathsheba sent a message to David saying that she was pregnant.

Maimakon ya daina, Dauda ya aiki wani ya kawo mashi ita. Ya kwana da ita, kuma ya aika ta gida. Bayan ɗan lokaci kaɗan Bat-sheba ta yi wa Dauda saƙo cewa tana da juna biyu.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-17-12.jpg?direct&}}

Bathsheba's husband, a man named Uriah, was one of David's best soldiers. David called Uriah back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But Uriah refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent Uriah back to the battle and told the general to place him where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.

Mijin Bat-Sheba, sunansa Uriya, ɗaya ne daga cikin sojojin Dauda mafi ƙwari. Dauda ya kira Uriya ya komo daga yaƙi, kuma faɗa masa ya je wajen matarsa. Amma Uriya ya ƙi ya koma gida ya bar sauran sojoji cikin yaƙi. Sai Dauda ya aike Uriya ya koma cikin yaƙi, kuma ya umurci shugaban ya sa shi a gaba inda akwai tsanani don a kashe shi.

After Uriah was killed, David married Bathsheba. Later, she gave birth to David's son. God was very angry about what David had done, so he sent the prophet Nathan to tell David how evil his sin was. David repented of his sin and God forgave him. For the rest of his life, David followed and obeyed God, even in difficult times.

Bayan da aka kashe Uriya, Dauda ya auri Bat-Sheba. Da jimawa, sai ta haifi ɗa. Allah ya husata sarai da abin da Dauda ya aikata, sai ya aike da annabi Natan ya faɗawa Dauda ƙazamin zunubinshi. Dauda ya tuba daga zunubin shi, kuma Allah ya gafarta masa. Sauran kwanakinsa, Dauda ya bi, ya kuma yi biyyaya ga Allah har a cikin lokacin wahala.

But as punishment for David's sin, his baby boy died. There was also fighting in David's family for the rest of his life, and David's power was greatly weakened. Though David had been unfaithful to God, God was still faithful to his promises. Later, David and Bathsheba had another son, and they named him Solomon.

//A Bible story from: 1 Samuel 10; 15-19; 24; 31; 2 Samuel 5; 7; 11-12//

//Amma hukuncin zunubin Dauda shine ɗansa namiji ya rasu. Akwai kuma jayyaya cikin iyalin Dauda duka sauran rayuwarshi. Ikon Dauda ya kuma rage ƙwarai. Ko da yake Dauda ya kasa wani lokaci, Allah bai janye alkawalinsa ba.//

//Bayan wani lokaci, Dauda da Bat-Sheba sun haifi wani yaro, sun kuma kira shi Sulemanu.//
