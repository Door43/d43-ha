Every year, the Jews celebrated the Passover. This was a celebration of how God had saved their ancestors from slavery in Egypt many centuries earlier. About three years after Jesus first began preaching and teaching publicly, Jesus told his disciples that he wanted to celebrate this Passover with them in Jerusalem, and that he would be killed there.

Kowace shekara Yahudawa suna sallar Idin ƙetarewa. Wannan Idin suna yin shi don tunawa da yadda Allah ya kuɓutar da kakanninsu daga bauta a Masar ƙarni dayawa da suka wuce. Kusan shekara uku bayan da Yesu ya fara wa'azi da kowaswa a fili, Yesu ya faɗawa almajiransa cewa yana so ya ci Idin ƙetarewa tare da su a Urshalima, kuma za a kashe shi a can.

One of Jesus' disciples was a man named Judas. Judas was in charge of the apostles' moneybag, but he loved money and often stole money out of the bag. After Jesus and the disciples arrived in Jerusalem, Judas went to the Jewish leaders and offered to betray Jesus to them in exchange for money. He knew that the Jewish leaders denied that Jesus was the Messiah and that they were plotting to kill him.

Ɗaya daga cikin almajiran Yesu yana da sunan Yahuda. Yahuda yana riƙe da jikar kuɗin manzani, amma yana da son kuɗi a zuciya, kuma yana satar kuɗi daga cikin jikar. Bayan da Yesu da almajiransa suka iso Urshalima, Yahuda ya je ganin shugabannin addini Yahudawa, kuma ya bada kansa domin cin amanar Yesu a maimakon kuɗi. Yana sane da cewa shugabannin Yahudawa sun yi musun Yesu ne Almasihu, kuma sun tsara su kashe shi.

The Jewish leaders, led by the high priest, paid Judas thirty silver coins to betray Jesus. This happened just as the prophets had predicted. Judas agreed, took the money, and went away. He began looking for an opportunity to help them arrest Jesus.

Shugabannin Yahudawa, tare da babban firist, suka biya Yahuza kuɗi tamma talatin don ya ci amanar Yesu. Wannan ya faru kamar yadda annabawa suka faɗa. Yahuza ya yarda, ya ƙarɓi kuɗin, kuma ya tafi. Ya fara neman halin da zai taimaka a kama Yesu.

In Jerusalem, Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples. During the Passover meal, Jesus took some bread and broke it. He said, "Take and eat this. This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me." In this way, Jesus said that his body would be sacrificed for them.

Cikin Urshalima, Yesu ya ci Idin ƙetarewa da almajiransa. Sa'adda suke cin Idin Ƙetarewa, Yesu ya ɗauki gurasa ya gutsutsura, Ya ce:" Ku ɗauka ku ci. Wannan jikinane da an bayar dominku. Yi wannan domin tunawa da Ni". Hakanan, Yesu ya faɗa cewa jikin za a miƙa shi hadaya dominsu.

Then Jesus picked up a cup and said, "Drink this. It is my blood of the New Covenant that is poured out for the forgiveness of sins. Do this to remember me every time you drink it."

Sai Yesu ya ɗauki ƙoƙon, kuma ya ce:" Ku sha. Jinina ne na Sabon Alkawali da aka zubas domin gafarar zunubai. Ku yi wannan domin tunawa da Ni kowane loton da ku ka sha shi".

Then Jesus said to the disciples, "One of you will betray me." The disciples were shocked, and asked who would do such a thing. Jesus said, "The person to whom I give this piece of bread is the betrayer." Then he gave the bread to Judas.

Sai Yesu ya cewa almajiransa:" Ɗaya daga cikinku zai bashe Ni". Almajiran suka damu, kuma suka yi tambaya wanene zai yi wannan abu. Yesu ya ce:" Mutumen wanda zan baiwa guntun brodi shine maci amana". Sai ya baiwa Yahuza brodin.

After Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. Judas left and went to help the Jewish leaders arrest Jesus. It was nighttime.

Bayan da Yahuza ɗauki breadin, Shaiɗan ya shiga cikin shi. Yahuza ya fita, kuma ya tafi ya taimaki shugabanin Yahudawa su kama Yesu. Cikin dare ne.

After the meal, Jesus and his disciples walked to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, "You will all abandon me tonight. It is written, 'I will strike the shepherd and all the sheep will be scattered.'"

Bayan abincin, Yesu da almajiransa suka tafi zuwa dutsen Zaitun. Yesu ya ce:" Za ku yashe ni da dare. A rubuce yake, " Zan bugi makiyayi, kuma dukan tumaki za su watse".

Peter replied, "Even if all the others abandon you, I will not!" Then Jesus said to Peter, "Satan wants to have all of you, but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith will not fail. Even so, tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny that you even know me three times."

Bitrus ya amsa ya ce:" Ko duka sauran sun yashe ka, ni ba zan bari ba!" Sai Yesu ya cewa Bitrus:" Shaiɗan yana bukatar dukanku, amma na yi addu'a dominku, Bitrus, don kadda bangaskiyar ka ta ɓace. Hakika da daren nan, kafin zakara ya yi cara za ka yi musun sanina sau uku".

Peter then said to Jesus, "Even if I must die, I will never deny you!" All the other disciples said the same thing.

Sai Bitrus ya cewa Yesu:" Hakika, ko da zan mutu, ba zan yi musun ka ba!" Duka sauran almajiran suka faɗi haka.

Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus told his disciples to pray that they would not enter into temptation. Then Jesus went to pray by himself.

Sai Yesu tafi tare da almajiransa wani wuri da ake kira Gatsemani. Yesu ya umurci al majiransa su yi addu'a don kadda su faɗa cikin jaraba. Sai Yesu ya tafi shi kaɗai yin addu'a.

Jesus prayed three times, "My Father, if it is possible, please let me not have to drink this cup of suffering. But if there is no other way for people's sins to be forgiven, then let your will be done." Jesus was very troubled and his sweat was like drops of blood. God sent an angel to strengthen him.

Yesu ya yi addu'a sau uku:" Uba, idan ya yiyu, kadda ka bari in sha wannan ƙoƙo na wahala. Amma in babu wata hanya domin mutane su samu gafarar zunubainsu, to bari nufin ka ya cika". Yesu ya damu ƙware har jiɓin jikinsa suna kama da jiɓin jini. Allah ya aike da mala'ika ya ƙarfafa shi.

After each time of prayer, Jesus came back to his disciples, but they were asleep. When he returned the third time, Jesus said, "Wake up! My betrayer is here."

Bayan kowane lokacin addu'a, Yesu yana komawa ga almajiransa, amma suna barci. Da ya sake komawa kari na uku, Yesu ya ce:" Ku tashi! Mai bashe ni ya zo".

Judas came with the Jewish leaders, soldiers, and a large crowd. They were carrying swords and clubs. Judas came to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Teacher," and kissed him. This was the sign for the Jewish leaders to know whom to arrest. Then Jesus said, "Judas, do you betray me with a kiss?"

Yahuza ya zo da shugabannin Yahudawa, da sojoji, kuma da taron jama'a. Suna ɗauke da takuba da kulake. Yahuza ya zo wurin Yesu ya ce:" Gaisuwa, Malan", kuma ya sumbace shi. Wannan ne alamar da shugaban Yahudawa za su kama shi. Sai Yesu ya ce:" Yahuza,ko ka bashe ni da sumba?"

As the soldiers arrested Jesus, Peter pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of a servant of the high priest. Jesus said, "Put the sword away! I could ask the Father for an army of angels to defend me. But I must obey my Father." Then Jesus healed the man's ear. After Jesus was arrested, all the disciples ran away.

//Sa'adda sojojin suka kama Yesu, Bitrus ya zare takobinshi ya yanke kunne ɗaya daga barorin babban firist. Yesu ya ce:" Maida takobinka! Ina iya tambayar Ubana rundunar mala'iku su kare ni. Amma zan yi biyyaya da Ubana". Sai Yesu ya warkar da kunnen mutumen. Bayan da aka kama Yesu, duka almajiran sun watse.//
