Jesus told many other stories about the kingdom of God. For example, he said, "The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed that someone planted in his field. You know that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all."

Yesu ya faɗi wasu labari da dama akan mulkin Allah. Kwatane, ya ce :" Mulkin Allah yana kama da ƙwayar mastard da aka shubka a cikin gona. Kun sani da cewa ƙwayar mastard ita ce mafi ƙanƙanuwa a cikin dukan iri".

"But when the mustard seed grows, it becomes the largest of all of the garden plants, big enough that even the birds come and rest in its branches."

" Amma in ƙwayar mastar ta tsiro, tana zama ice mafi girma cikin dukan shuka garka, da girma sosai har da tsuntsaye suna sabka suna hutawa a bisan reshennu ta".

Jesus told another story, "The kingdom of God is like yeast that a woman mixes into some bread dough until it spreads throughout the dough."

Yesu ya faɗi wani labari:" Mulkin Allah yana kama da yesty da wata mace take damawa cikin garin brodi, yana kumbura dukan ƙullin".

"The kingdom of God is also like treasure that someone hid in a field. Another man found the treasure and then buried it again. He was so filled with joy that he went and sold everything he had and used the money to buy that field."

" Mulkin Allah yana kuwa kama da ajiyar da wani ya ɓoye a cikin gona. Wani mutum ya samu ajiyar, sai ya bizne ta hallo. Ya cika da farin ciki har ya je ya saida dukan mallakarsa, kuma ya yi anfani da ƙuɗin ya sayi gonar".

"The kingdom of God is also like a perfect pearl of great value. When a pearl merchant found it, he sold all that he had and used the money to buy it."

" Mulkin Allah kuma yana kama da ingantacen lu'u lu'u. Da wani mai kasuwancin lu'u-lu'u ya same shi, sai ya saida dukan mallakarsa ya yi anfani da kuɗin ya saye ta".

Then Jesus told a story to some people who trusted in their own good deeds and despised other people. He said, "Two men went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector, and the other was a religious leader."

Sai Yesu ya faɗawa wasu mutane da suke dogara ga kyaukawan aikinsu, kuma suna ƙyamar waɗansu, wani  labari. Ya ce :" Mutum biyu suka tafi Haikali garin yin addu'a. Ɗaya daga cikinsu mai ƙarbar haraji ne, kuma ɗayan shugaban addini ne".

"The religious leader prayed like this, 'Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector.'"

" Shugaban addinin ya yi addu'a kamar haka:" Na gode Allah da shi ke ni ba mai zunubi bane kamar sauran maza, ko kamar ɓarayi, marasa adilci, fasiƙai, ko kuwa kamar wannan mai ƙarɓar haraji".

"'For example, I fast two times every week and I give you ten percent of all the money and goods that I receive.'"

"Bayani, ina azumi sau biyu kowane sati, kuma ina baka zakkar dukan kuɗi da kayan da nake samu".

"But the tax collector stood far away from the religious leader, and did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest with his fist and prayed, 'God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.'"

" Amma mai ƙabar haraji ya tsaya nesa da shugaban addinin, kuma bai ma ɗaga kai sama ba. A maimakon haka ya buga ƙirjinsa da dunƙullen hannu, kuma ya yi addu'a  kamar haka:" Ka ji ƙai na ya Allah, gama ni mai zunubi ne".

Then Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, God heard the tax collector's prayer and declared him to be righteous. But he did not like the religious leader's prayer. God will humble everyone who is proud, and he will lift up whoever humbles himself."

//Sai Yesu ya ce:" Ina gaya maka gaskiya, Allah ya ji addu'ar mai ƙarɓar haraji, kuma ya shaida shi mai addini ne. Amma bai ƙarɓi addu'ar shugaban addini ba. Allah zai ƙasƙantar da duk wanda yake ɗaga kansa, kuma ya ɗaukaka duka wanda ya ƙasƙantar da kan shi".//
