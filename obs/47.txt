As Saul traveled throughout the Roman Empire, he began to use his Roman name, "Paul." One day, Paul and his friend Silas went to the town of Philippi to proclaim the good news about Jesus. They went to a place by the river outside the city where people gathered to pray. There they met a woman named Lydia who was a merchant. She loved and worshiped God.

Da Shawulu yake tafia cikin Daular Roma, ya fara anfani da sunan shi na Roma," Bulus". Wata rana, Bulus da abokinsa Silas suka tafi wani garin Filipi su shaida bisharar Yesu. Suka tafi wani wuri kusan kogi waje da garin inda mutane suka taru su yi addu'a. Can suka sadu da wata mace da ake kira Lidiya mai kasuwanci. Tana kauna kuma tana yabo Allah.

God opened Lydia's heart to believe the message about Jesus, and she and her family were baptized. She invited Paul and Silas to stay at her house, so they stayed with her and her family.

Allah ya bude zuciyar Lidiya ta bada gaskiya da sako a kan Yesu, kuma ita da iyalinta aka yi masu baftisma. Ta gayaci Bulus da Silas su zauna a gidanta, sai suka zauna da ita da iyalinta.

Paul and Silas often met with people at the place of prayer. Every day as they walked there, a slave girl possessed by a demon followed them. By means of this demon she predicted the future for people, so she made a lot of money for her masters as a fortuneteller.

Bulus da Silas suka sadu da mutane a wurin addu'a. Kowace rana yayin da suke tafiya can, wata yarinya baiwa, mai aljani ta bi bayan su. Ta wurin wannan aljani tana wa mutane duba , ta samu kudi da yawa don uwayen gidanta.

The slave girl kept yelling as they walked, "These men are servants of the Most High God. They are telling you the way to be saved!" She did this so often that Paul became annoyed.

Baiwar ta ci gaba da kiransu da karfi sa'adda suke tafiya:" Wadannan mutane ma'aikatan Allah Madaukaki ne. Suna fada maki yadda za ki tsira!" Ta yi hakanan so da yawa har Bulus ya damu.

Finally one day when the slave girl started yelling, Paul turned to her and said to the demon that was in her, "In the name of Jesus, come out of her." Right away the demon left her.

A karshe, wata rana da baiwar ta fara kara, Bulus ya juya gareta ya ce wa aljanin da ke cikinta:" A cikin sunan Yesu fita daga cikinta". Nan take aljanin ya fita.

The men who owned the slave girl became very angry! They realized that without the demon, the slave girl could not tell people the future. This meant that people would no longer pay her owners money so that she would tell them what would happen to them.

Mutumen mai baiwar ya husata sarai! Sun gane da cewa banda aljanin, baiwar ba za ta iya duba ba. Kenan mutane ba za su kara biyan kudi ga uwayen gidanta, domin ta yi musu duba.

So the owners of the slave girl took Paul and Silas to the Roman authorities, who beat them and threw them into jail.

Sai uwayen gidan baiwar suka kai Bulus da Silas wurin hukumar Roma inda aka buge su, kuma aka sa su cikin kurkuku.

They put Paul and Silas in the most secure part of the prison and even locked up their feet. Yet in the middle of the night, they were singing songs of praise to God.

Sai suka sa Bulus da Silas cikin wuri mafi tsarare cikin kason,kuma suka daure kafafunsu da sarkoki. Kuma cikin tsakiyar dare suka ci gaba suna raira wakokin yabo ga Allah.

Suddenly, there was a violent earthquake! All the prison doors flew open, and the chains of all the prisoners fell off.

Ba zato ba tsammani, sai aka yi girgizar kasa! Dukan kofofin kurkuku suka bude, kuma sarkokin dukan yan kason suka zube.

The jailer woke up, and when he saw that the prison doors were open, he was terrified! He thought all the prisoners had escaped, so he planned to kill himself. (He knew the Roman authorities would kill him if he allowed the prisoners to escape.) But Paul saw him and yelled, "Stop! Do not hurt yourself. We are all here."

Mai gadin kurkukun ya tashi, da ya ga kofofin kaso a bude, ya tsorota! Ya yi tsammani dukan yan kaso sun gudu, sai ya nufa ya kashe kanshi.( Ya sani hukumar Roma za su kashe shi in ya bar yan kaso sun tsere). Amma Bulus ya gane shi, kuma ya kira shi:" Tsaya! Kadda ka ji wa kanka ciwo. Duka muna nan".

The jailer trembled as he came to Paul and Silas and asked, "What must I do to be saved?" Paul answered, "Believe in Jesus, the Master, and you and your family will be saved." Then the jailer took Paul and Silas into his home and washed their wounds. Paul preached the good news about Jesus to everyone in his

Mai gadin ya yi rawar jiki da yake isa wajen Bulus da Silas, ya tambaya:" Me zan yi in samu ceto?" Bulus ya amsa:" Gaskanta ga Yesu Ubangiji, kuma kai da iyalinka za ku tsira". Sai mai gadin ya kai Bulus da Silas cikin gidansa, kuma ya wanke ciwonsu. Bulus ya shaida bisharar Yesu ga kowa cikin

The jailer and his whole family believed in Jesus and were baptized. Then the jailer gave Paul and Silas a meal and they rejoiced together.

Mai gadin kason da duk iyalinsa suka bada gaskiya kuma aka yi masu baftisma. Sai ma gadin ya baiwa Bulus da Silas abinci, kuma suka yi murna tare.

The next day the leaders of the city released Paul and Silas from prison and asked them to leave Philippi. Paul and Silas visited Lydia and some other friends and then left the city. The good news about Jesus kept spreading, and the Church kept growing.

Ranar gobe shugabanni garin suka saki Bulus da Silas daga kurkuku, kuma suka ce masu su bar Filipi. Bulus da Silas suka ziyarci Lidiya da sauran abokansu, kuma suka bar garin. Labari mai dadi a kan Yesu ya ci gaba da yaduwa, kuma Ekkliziya ta ci gaba da girma.

Paul and other Christian leaders traveled to many cities, preaching and teaching people the good news about Jesus. They also wrote many letters to encourage and teach the believers in the churches. Some of these letters became books of the Bible.

//A Bible story from: Acts 16:11-40//

//Bulus da sauran shugabannin krista suka yi tafiya zuwa garuruwa da yawa, suna shaida bishara, kuma suna koyas da mutane a kan Yesu. Suka kuwa rubuta wasikoki da yawa na karfafawa da na koyaswa masu bi cikin Ekkliziyoyi. Wasu daga wadannan wasiku suka zama littatafai Littafi Mai Tsarki.//
