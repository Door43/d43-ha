One day, Jesus received a message that Lazarus was very sick. Lazarus and his two sisters, Mary and Martha, were close friends of Jesus. When Jesus heard this news, he said, "This sickness will not end in death, but it is for the glory of God." Jesus loved his friends, but he waited where he was for two days.

Wata rana, Yesu ya samu saƙo cewa Li'azaru yana rashin lafiya ƙwarai. Li'azaru da ƴanuwansa mata biyu, Maryamu da Marta, abokan Yesu ne. Da Yesu ya ji wannan labarin, ya ce:" Wannan cutar ba za ta ƙare ba har mutuwa, amma domin ɗaukakar Allah ne". Yesu yana ƙaunar abokansa, amma ya jira inda yake har kwana biyu.

After the two days had passed, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go back to Judea." "But Teacher," the disciples answered, "Just a short time ago the people there wanted to kill you!" Jesus said, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, and I must wake him."

Bayan kwana biyu sun wuce, Yesu ya cewa almajiransa:" Mu koma Yahudiya". Amma malan" Almajiran suka amsa:" Ba da daɗewa ba mutanen garin sun nemi su kashe ka!" Yesu ya ce:" Ɗan uwnamu Li'azaru ya yi barci, kuma dolle in tashe shi".

Jesus' disciples replied, "Master, if Lazarus is sleeping, then he will get better." Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead. I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe in me."

Almajiran Yesu suka amsa suka ce:" Malan, in Li'azaru ya yi barci, kenan zai samu lafiya". Sai Yesu ya ce masu a sake:" Li'azaru ya mutu. Ina da farin ciki da bana nan, domin ku gaskanta da ni".

When Jesus arrived at Lazarus' hometown, Lazarus had already been dead for four days. Martha went out to meet Jesus and said, "Master, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I believe God will give you whatever you ask from him."

Da Yesu ya iso garin Li'azaru, Li'azaru ya yi kwana uku da rasuwa. Marta ta tafi tarbenshi, kuma ta ce:" Malan, inda kana nan, da ɗan uwana bai mutu ba. Amma na tabbata Allah zai baka duk abin da ka tambaye shi".

Jesus replied, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies. Everyone who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?" Martha answered, "Yes, Master! I believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God."

Yesu ya amsa ya ce:" Ni ne tashin mattatu da kuma rai. Duk wanda ya gaskanta da ni zai rayu koda ya mutu. Duk wanda ya gaskanta da ni ba zai ƙara mutuwa ba. Kun gaskanta da wannan?" Marta ta amsa:" I, Malan! Na gaskanta kai ne Almasihu, Ɗan Allah".

Then Mary arrived. She fell at the feet of Jesus and said, "Master, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died." Jesus asked them, "Where have you put Lazarus?" They told him, "In the tomb. Come and see." Then Jesus wept.

Sai Maryamu ta zo. Ta faɗi a ƙafafuwan Yesu ta ce:" Malan, inda kana nan, ɗan uwana da bai mutu ba." Yesu ya tambaye su:" Ina ku ka sa Li'azaru?" Suka ce masa:" cikin kushewa. Zo ka gani". Sai Yesu ya yi kuka.

The tomb was a cave with a stone rolled in front of its opening. When Jesus arrived at the tomb, he told them, "Roll the stone away." But Martha said, "He has been dead for four days. There will be a bad smell."

Kushewar kogone a rufe da dutse a gaban wurin buɗewa. Da Yesu ya iso kushewar, ya ce masu:" Ku ture dutsen". Amma Marta ta ce:" Yayi kwana uku da mutuwa. Ya riga ya ruɓe".

Jesus responded, "Did I not tell you that you would see God's glory if you believe in me?" So they rolled the stone away.

Yesu ya amsaya ce:" Ba na faɗa maku za ku ga ɗaukakar Allah inda kun gaskanta da niba?" Sai suka ture dutsen.

Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, "Father, thank you for hearing me. I know you always listen to me, but I say this for the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will believe you sent me." Then Jesus shouted, "Lazarus, come out!"

Sai Yesu ya ɗaga kai sama ya ce:" Uba, na gode da ka saurare ni. Na san kullum kana ji na, amma ina faɗin wannan domin dukan  waɗannan mutane da ke tsaye a nan, don su tabbata kai ka aiko ni". Sai Yesu ya yi ƙara:" Li'azaru, fito waje!"

So Lazarus came out! He was still wrapped in grave clothes. Jesus told them, "Help him take off those grave clothes and release him!" Many of the Jews believed in Jesus because of this miracle.

Sai Li'azaru ya fito! Yana sanye da tuffafin kabari. Yesu ya ce masu:" Ku taimake shi ya hudda waɗannan kayan na kabari, kuma ku sake shi! Da yawa daga Yahudawa suka gaskanta da Yesu domin al'ajabai da ya yi.

But the religious leaders of the Jews were jealous, so they gathered together to plan how they could kill Jesus and Lazarus.
