Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh. They said, "This is what the God of Israel says, 'Let my people go!'" Pharaoh did not listen to them. Instead of letting the Israelites go free, he forced them to work even harder!

Musa da Harouna suka je wurin Fir'auna suka ce:" Ga abin da Allah na Isra'ila ya ce,"Bar mutane na su fita daga ƙasarka!" Fir'auna ya taurare zuciyarsa. Maimakon ya bar Isra'ilawa su tafi, sai ƙara nauyin aikinsu.

Pharaoh kept refusing to let the people go, so God sent ten terrible plagues on Egypt. Through these plagues, God showed Pharaoh that he is more powerful than Pharaoh and all of Egypt's gods.

Fir'auna ya ƙi ya bar mutanen su tafi, sai Allah ya aiko alloba goma a Masar. Ta wurin wannan allobar, Allah ya nuna wa Fir'auna ya fi shi iko da shi da dukkan allolin Masar.

God turned the Nile River into blood, but Pharaoh still would not let the Israelites go.

Allah ya maida ruwan kogin Nilu jini, amma duk da wannan Fir'auna ya ƙi barin Isra'ilawa su tafi.

God sent frogs all over Egypt. Pharaoh begged Moses to take away the frogs. But after all the frogs died, Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the Israelites leave Egypt.

Allah ya aiko da Kwaɗi a Masar. Fir'auna ya roƙi Musa ya kawas da kwaɗin. Amma bayan da kwaɗin sun mutu, Fir'auna ya taurare zuciyarshi, ya ƙi ya bar isra'ilawa su fita daga Masar.

So God sent a plague of gnats. Then he sent a plague of flies. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them that if they stopped the plague, the Israelites could leave Egypt. When Moses prayed, God removed all the flies from Egypt. But Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go free.

Sai Allah ya aiko allabar kwarkwata. Ya kuma aiko kwarkwatar ƙudaje. Fir'auna ya kira Musa da Haruna ya ce masu idan sun tsaida allaobar, Isra'ilawa suna iya fita daga Masar. Da Musa yayi addu'a, Allah ya ɗauke duk ƙudaje daga Masar. Amma Fir'auna ya ƙara taurare zuciyarsa ya hana su fita.

Next, God caused all the farm animals that belonged to the Egyptians to get sick and die. But Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go.

Sai kuma Allah ya sa dukkan dabbobin masarawa rashin lafia da mutuwa. Duk da wannan Fir'auna ya taurare zuciyarsa, ya ƙi ya bar Isra'ilawa su tafi.

Then God told Moses to throw ashes into the air in front of Pharaoh. When he did, painful skin sores appeared on the Egyptians, but not on the Israelites. God hardened Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go free.

Sai Allah ya ambaci Musa ya watsa toka cikin iska a gaban Fir'auna. Da yayi hakannan sai marurai masu zafin ciwo suka fito a jikin masarawa, banda isra'ilawa. Allah ya taurara zuciyar Fir'auna, kuma Fir'auna bai yarda isra'ilawa su fita ba.

After that, God sent hail that destroyed most of the crops in Egypt and killed anybody who went outside. Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and told them, "I have sinned. You may go." So Moses prayed, and the hail stopped falling from the sky.

Bayan wannan, Allah ya aike da ƙanƙara da ta hallaka yawancin anfanin gonar Masar da duk mutanen da ke waje a lokacin. Fir'auna ya kira Musa da Haruna ya ce masu:" Na yi zunubi. Sai ku tafi" Sai Musa yayi addu'a, sai ƙanƙara ta fasa faɗowa.

But Pharaoh sinned again and hardened his heart. He would not let the Israelites go free.

Amma Fir'auna ya ƙara zunubi, ya kuma taurare zuciyarsa. Ya ƙi ya bar isra'ilawa su tafi.

So God caused swarms of locusts to come over Egypt. These locusts ate all the crops that the hail had not destroyed.

Sai Allah ya sa ɗumbun fara suka faɗo kan Masar. Fara sun cinye duk ganyen da ƙanƙara ba ta hallaka ba.

Then God sent darkness that lasted for three days. It was so dark that the Egyptians could not leave their houses. But there was light where the Israelites lived.

Sai kuma Allah ya aiko da duhu har kwana uku. Duhun yayi yawa har da masarawa basu iya barin gidajensu ba. Amma akwai haske a inda isra'ilawa suke.

Even after these nine plagues, Pharaoh still refused to let the Israelites go free. Since Pharaoh would not listen, God planned to send one last plague. This would change Pharaoh's mind.

//A Bible story from: Exodus 5-10//

//Duk da haka bayan waɗannan allobai tara, Fir'auna ya ƙi ya saki isra'ilawa su tafi. Tun da Fir'auna ba ya ji, Allah ya ƙadara ya aika alloba ta ƙarshe. Wannan za ta canza tunaninsa.//
