After overcoming Satan's temptations, Jesus returned in the power of the Holy Spirit to the region of Galilee where he lived. Jesus went from place to place teaching. Everyone spoke well of him.

Bayan da ya ci nasara da jarabobin Shaidan, Yesu ya koma da ikon Ruhu Mai Tsarki garin Galili inda yake zaune. Yesu ya yi tafiya daga wani wuri zuwa wani wuri yana koyaswa. Kowa yana zancen shi da kyau.

Jesus went to the town of Nazareth where he had lived during his childhood. On the Sabbath, he went to the place of worship. They handed him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah so that he would read from it. Jesus opened up the scroll and read part of it to the people.

Yesu ya je garin Nazarat inda ya zauna yana yaro. Ran Asabar ya tafi wurin sujada. Suka bashi litafin annabi Ishaya don ya yi karatu. Yesu ya buɗe litafin, kuma ya karanta wa mutanen daga cikinsa.

Jesus read, "God has given me his Spirit so that I can proclaim good news to the poor, freedom to captives, recovery of sight for the blind, and release to the oppressed. This is the year of the Lord's favor."

Yesu ya karanta:" Allah ya ba ni Ruhunsa domin in shaida wa matalauta bishara, saki ga ɗauraru, in buɗewa makafi ido, in ƴantas da wanda suke a ɗanne. Wannan ce shekarar ƙarbuwa ga Ubangiji.

Then Jesus sat down. Everybody watched him closely. They knew the passage of scripture that he had just read referred to the Messiah. Jesus said, "The words I just read to you are happening right now." All the people were amazed. "Isn't this the son of Joseph?" they said.

Sai Yesu ya zauna a ƙasa. Kowa yana kallonsa a kusa. Sun san labarin LMT da ya karanta yana ambatar Almasihu. Yesu ya ce:" Maganar da na karanta tana faruwa da ku a yanzu". Dukan mutane suka yi mamaki suka ce:" Ba shine ɗan Yusufu ba?"

Then Jesus said, "It is true that no prophet is accepted in his own hometown. During the time of the prophet Elijah, there were many widows in Israel. But when it did not rain for three and a half years, God did not send Elijah to help a widow from Israel, but rather to a widow from a different nation."

Sai Yesu ya ce:" Gaskiya ne ba annabin da ake mutuntawa a garinshi. Lokacin annabi Iliya, akwai mata da yawa da mazansu suka mutu a Isra'ila. Amma lokacin da ba a yi ruwan sama ba har shekara uku da rabi, Allah bai aiki Iliya ba don ya taimaki gwauruwa ta Isra'ila, amma ya taimaki gwauruwa ta wata kabila."

Jesus continued saying, "And during the time of the prophet Elisha, there were many people in Israel with skin diseases. But Elisha did not heal any of them. He only healed the skin disease of Naaman, a commander of Israel's enemies." The people who were listening to Jesus were Jews. So when they heard him say this, they were furious at him.

Yesu ya ci gaba da cewa:" Kuma zamanin annabi Elisha  akwai kutare dayawa a Isra'ila. Amma Elisha bai warkar da su ba. Ya warkas da kuturtar Na'aman kaɗai, shugaban yaƙin abokan gaban Isra'ila. Mutanen da suke sauraron Yesu Yahudawa ne. To da suka ji shi yana faɗin wannan sai suka husata.

The people of Nazareth dragged Jesus out of the place of worship and brought him to the edge of a cliff to throw him off of it in order to kill him. But Jesus walked through the crowd and left the town of Nazareth.

Mutanen Nazarat suka janye Yesu waje daga wurin sujada, kuma suka kai shi bayan gari suka jefas shi suna neman kashe shi. Amma Yesu ya ratsa cikin jama'a, kuma ya bar garin Nazarat.

Then Jesus went throughout the region of Galilee, and large crowds came to him. They brought many people who were sick or handicapped, including those who could not see, walk, hear, or speak, and Jesus healed them.

Sai Yesu ya yi tafiyarsa zuwa wani gari a Galili, kuma sai taro mai yawa suka zo gareshi. Suka kawo marasa lafiya dayawa da nakassasu, har da makafi, guragu da baibaye, kuma Yesu ya warkadda su.

Many people who had demons in them were brought to Jesus. At Jesus' command, the demons came out of the people, and often shouted, "You are the Son of God!" The crowds of people were amazed and worshiped God.

Mutane da yaw masu aljannu, aka kawo su wurin Yesu. Da faɗar Yesu, aljannun suka fita daga mutanen, suka kuma furta:" Kai ne Ɗan Allah!" Mutanen taron suka yi mamaki, suka kuma ɗaukaka Allah.

Then Jesus chose twelve men who were called his apostles. The apostles traveled with Jesus and learned from him.
