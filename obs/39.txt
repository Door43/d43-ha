It was now the middle of the night. The soldiers led Jesus to the house of the high priest in order for the high priest to question him. Peter followed far behind them. When Jesus was taken into the house, Peter stayed outside and warmed himself by a fire.

Yanzu cikin tsakiyar dare ne. Sojojin suka kai Yesu gidan babban firist domin babban firit kin ya yi masa tambayyoyi. Bitrus yana biye da su daga nesa. Da aka sa Yesu cikin gidan, Bitrus ya tsaya a waje, kuma ya gunguma kansa kusan wuta.

Inside the house, the Jewish leaders put Jesus on trial. They brought many false witnesses who lied about him. However, their statements did not agree with each other, so the Jewish leaders could not prove he was guilty of anything. Jesus did not say anything.

Cikin gidan shugabannin Yahudawa suka kai Yesu gaban shari'a. Suka kawo shaidun ƙarya da yawa suka masa shaidar zur. Duk da wannan, bayanaisu ba su zo dai-dai da juna ba, sai shugabannin Yahudawa ba su iya samu shaidar laifinsa ba. Yesu bai ce komi ba.

Finally, the high priest looked directly at Jesus and said, "Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of the living God?"

A ƙarshe, babban priest ya dubi Yesu a idanu, kuma ya ce:" Faɗa mana, kai ne Almasihu, Ɗan Allah mai rai?"

Jesus said, "I am, and you will see me seated with God and coming from heaven." The high priest tore his clothes in anger and shouted to the other religious leaders, "We do not need any more witnesses! You have heard him say that he is the Son of God. What is your judgment?"

Yesu ya ce:" Ni ne, kuma za ku ganni zaune tare da Allah, ina zuwa daga sama". Babban priest ya tsaga tufafinsa cikin baƙin  ciki, kuma ya yi ƙara ga sauran shugabannin addini:" Ba ma bukatar wasu shaidu! Kun ji ya ce shine Ɗan Allah. Menene shari'arku?"

The Jewish leaders all answered the high priest, "He deserves to die!" Then they blindfolded Jesus, spit on him, hit him, and mocked him.

Shugabanin Yahudawa duka suka amsa wa babban firist:" Ya cancanci mutuwa!" Sai suka ɗaure masa idanu, suka tofa masa yau, suka duke shi, kuma suka yi masa ba'a.

As Peter was waiting outside the house, a servant girl saw him and said to him, "You also were with Jesus!" Peter denied it. Later, another girl said the same thing, and Peter denied it again. Finally, the people said, "We know that you were with Jesus because you both are from Galilee."

Sa'adda Bitrus yake jira waje da gidan, wata baiwa ta gane shi, kuma ta ce masa:" Kaima kana tare da Yesu!" Bitrus ya yi musun sa. Da jimawa, wata yarinya ta sake faɗin hakanan, kuma Bitrus ya sake yin musun shi. A ƙarshe, mutanen suka ce:" Mun sani da kana tare da Yesu domin yawancin ku kun fito daga Galili".

Then Peter vowed, saying, "May God curse me if I know this man!" Immediately, a rooster crowed, and Jesus turned around and looked at Peter.

Sai Bitrus ya yi shelar cewa:" Bari Allah ya la'antani in na san wannan mutumen! Nan da nan, sai zakara ya yi cara, kuma Yesu ya juya ya kalli Bitrus.

Peter went away and cried bitterly. Meanwhile, Judas, the betrayer, saw that the Jewish leaders had condemned Jesus to die. Judas became full of sorrow and went away and killed himself.

Bitrus ya tafi nesa, kuma ya yi kuka mai zafi. Lokacinan, Yahuza, wanda ya ci amana, ya gani shugabannin Yahudawa sun shar'anta Yesu ya mutu. Yahuza ya cika da baƙin ciki, kuma sai ya tafi ya kashe kanshi.

Early the next morning, the Jewish leaders brought Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor. They hoped that Pilate would condemn Jesus as guilty and sentence him to be killed. Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

Washe gari da asuba, shugabanin Yahudawa suka kai Yesu gaban Bilatus, mai mulkin Roma. Sun zata Bilatus zai ɗora masa laifi, kuma ya sa a kashe shi. Bilatus ya tambayi Yesu:" Kai na sarkin yahudawa?"

Jesus answered, "You have said so, but my kingdom is not an earthly kingdom. If it were, my servants would fight for me. I have come to earth to tell the truth about God. Everyone who loves the truth listens to me." Pilate said, "What is truth?"

Yesu ya amsa:" Haka ku ka faɗa, amma mulkina ba mulkin ƙasa ba ne. Inda hakane, da barorina sun yi yaƙi domina. Na zo da duniya in faɗi gaskiar Allah. Duk wanda yake ƙaunar gaskiya yana saurare na". Bilatus ya ce:" Menene gaskiyarka?"

After speaking with Jesus, Pilate went out to the crowd and said, "I find no guilt in this man." But the Jewish leaders and the crowd shouted, "Crucify him!" Pilate replied, "He is not guilty." But they shouted even louder. Then Pilate said a third time, "He is not guilty!"

Bayan da ya yi magana da Yesu, Bilatus ya fita waje wurin taro ya ce:" Ban samu laifin wannan mutum ba".  Amma shugabanin Yahudawa da taron suka yi ƙara:" A giciye shi!" Bilatus ya amsa:" Ba shi da  laifi". Amma sai suka yi ƙara da ƙarfi. Sai Bilatus ya sake faɗi sau na uku:" Ba shi da laifi!"

Pilate became afraid that the crowd would begin to riot, so he ordered his soldiers to crucify Jesus. The Roman soldiers whipped Jesus and put a royal robe and a crown made of thorns on him. Then they mocked him by saying, "Look, the King of the Jews!"
