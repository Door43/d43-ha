The Israelites were very happy to leave Egypt. They were no longer slaves, and they were going to the Promised Land! The Egyptians gave the Israelites whatever they asked for, even gold and silver and other valuable things. Some people from other nations believed in God and went along with the Israelites as they left Egypt.

Isra'ilawa sun cika da murna da barin Masar. Sun zama ƴantattu, sun kama hanya zuwa ƙasar alkawali! Masarawa sun ba isra'ilawa duk abin da suka tambaye su, har da zinariya da azurfa da duk abubuwa masu tsada.

Waɗansu mutanen wasu kabilu suka gaskanta da Allah, suka ka kwa raka isra'ilawa yayin da suka fita daga Masar.

God led them with a tall pillar of cloud that went ahead of them during the day, and which became a tall pillar of fire at night. God was always with them and guided them as they traveled. All they had to do was follow him.

Allah ya bida su da al'amudin girgije da yake jagoransu da rana, kuma da dare sai ya zama al'amudin wuta. Allah yana tare da su kulluyaumin, ya kuma jagorance su lokacin tafiyarsu. Duk abin da za su yi shi ne su bi shi.

After a short time, Pharaoh and his people changed their minds and wanted the Israelites to be their slaves again. God caused Pharaoh to be stubborn so that people would see he is the One True God, and understand that he, Yahweh, is more powerful than Pharaoh and his gods.

Bayan ɗan lokaci, Fir'auna da mutanensa suka canza tunaninsu, kuma sai suka so su maido da isra'ilawa su zama bayinsu hallo. Allah ya sa Fir'auna ya zama mai taurin kai domin mutane su gane da cewa shi ƙaɗai ne Allah na gaskiya, shine Yahweh, ya kuma fi Fir'auna da allolinsa iko.

So Pharaoh and his army chased after the Israelites to make them their slaves again. When the Israelites saw the Egyptian army coming, they realized they were trapped between Pharaoh's army and the Red Sea. They were very afraid and cried out, "Why did we leave Egypt? We are going to die!"

Sai Fir'auna da sojojinsa suka tafi bin bayan isra'ilawa don su maida su bayi hallo. Da isra'ilawa suka ga rundunar sojojin Masar suna bin bayansu, sai suka gani sun kamu a tarko tsakanin sojojin Fir'auna da bahar Maliya. Sun firgita sosai, kuma suka yi ƙara:" Don mi muka fito daga Masar? Za mu mutu!"

Moses told the Israelites, "Stop being afraid! God will fight for you today and save you." Then God told Moses, "Tell the people to move toward the Red Sea."

Musa ya faɗa wa isra'ilawa:" Kadda ku ji tsoro! Allah zai yi yaƙi dominku yau, ya kuma cece ku". Sai Allah ya cewa Musa:" Gaya wa mutane su kusato Bahar Maliya".

Then God moved the pillar of cloud and placed it between the Israelites and the Egyptians so the Egyptians could not see the Israelites.

Sai Allah ya gusa al'amudin girgije, ya sa shi tsakanin isra'ilawa da masarawa domin kadda masarawan su ga isra'ilawa.

God told Moses to raise his hand over the sea and divide the waters. Then God caused wind to push the water in the sea to the left and the right, so that a path formed through the sea.

Allah ya cewa Musa ya ɗaga hannunsa bisan bahar ya raba ruwayen. Sai Allah ya sa iska ya ture ruwan cikin Bahar zuwa hagum da dama, haka sai hanya ta samu tsakiyar bahar.

The Israelites marched through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on either side of them.

Isra'ilawa suka ratsa tsakiyar Bahar bisa bussashiyar ƙasa da duk ruwaye a kowane gefen.

Then God moved the cloud up and out of the way so that the Egyptians could see the Israelites escaping. The Egyptians decided to chase after them.

Sai Allah ya gusa girgijen gaba, ba bisa kan hanyar ba, don masarawa su gani isra'ilawa sun kuɓuta. Masarawan sun ƙudurta su bi bayansu.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-12-10.jpg?direct&}}

So they followed the Israelites onto the path through the sea, but God caused the Egyptians to panic and caused their chariots to get stuck. They shouted, "Run away! God is fighting for the Israelites!"

Sai suka bi bayan isra'ilawan bisa hanyar cikin Bahar, amma Allah ya tsorota masarawan, ƙafafun karusansu suka kafe. Suka yi ƙara:" Ku gudu! Allah yana kokowa domin Isra'ilawa!"

After the Israelites all made it safely to the other side of the sea, God told Moses to stretch out his arm again. When  he obeyed, the water fell on the Egyptian army and returned to its normal place. The whole Egyptian army drowned.

Bayan da Isra'ilawa suka kai wancen sashen teku lafia, Allah ya cewa Musa ya sake ɗaga hannunsa kuma. Da ya yi biyyaya, Ruwa ya faɗo kan rundunar sojoj Masar, ya kuma koma wurinsa na da. Dukan rundunar sojojin Masar suka ciyu.

When the Israelites saw that the Egyptians were dead, they trusted in God and believed that Moses was a prophet of God.

Da Isra'ilawa suka ga masarawan sun mutu, sai suka gaskanta da Allah da kuma Musa annabin Allah.

The Israelites also rejoiced with much excitement because God had saved them from death and slavery! Now they were free to serve God. The Israelites sang many songs to celebrate their new freedom and to praise God because he saved them from the Egyptian army.

Isra'ilawa suka ka yi farin ciki sosai sabili da Allah ya cece su daga mutuwa, kuma daga bauta! Yanzu sun ƴantattu ne

domin sun bauta ma Allah. Isra'ilawa sun raira waƙoƙin yabo da dama domin ƴancin da suka samu, kuma yabon Allah domin ya cece su daga rundunar sojojin Masar.

God commanded the Israelites to celebrate the Passover every year in order to remember how God gave them victory over the Egyptians and rescued them from being slaves. They celebrated by killing a perfect lamb, eating it with unleavened bread.

//A Bible story from: Exodus 12:33-15:21//

//Allah ya umurci Isra'ilawa su yi idin ƙetarewa kowace shakara domin su tuna da yadda Allah ya basu nasara kan masarawa, ya kuma cece su daga bauta. Suka yi idin ta wurin kashe ɗan rago maras aibu, suka ci shi da gurasa maras yisti.//
