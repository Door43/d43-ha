As the boys grew up, Jacob loved to stay at home, but Esau loved to hunt. Rebekah loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau.

Sa'ad da samarin suka girma, Yakubu ya fi son zama a gida, amma Isuwa yana son farauta. Rifkatu ta fi ƙaunar Yakubu, amma Ishaƙu ya fi ƙaunar Isuwa.

One day, when Esau came back from hunting, he was very hungry. Esau said to Jacob, "Please give me some of the food you have made." Jacob responded, "First, give me your rights as the oldest son." So Esau gave Jacob his rights as the oldest son. Then Jacob gave him some food.

Wata rana da Isuwa ya dawo daga farauta, ya ji yunwa sosai. Isuwa ya cewa Yakubu:" Dan Allah ka bani ɗan abinci da ka dafa". Yakubu ya amsa ya ce:" Sai ka bani matsayinka na ɗan fari." Sai Isuwa ya baiwa Yakubu matsayinshi na ɗan fari. Sa'annan Yakubu ya bashi abinci.

Isaac wanted to give his blessing to Esau. But before he did, Rebekah and Jacob tricked him by having Jacob pretend to be Esau. Isaac was old and could no longer see. So Jacob put on Esau's clothes and put goatskins on his neck and hands.

Ishaƙu yana so ya sa wa Isuwa albarka. Amma kafin yayi Rifkatu da Yakubu suka yaudare shi ta wurin sawa Yakubu kanbacin Isuwa.

Ishaƙu ya tsufa, kuma makafo ne. Sai Yakubu ya sa tufar Isuwa, ya kuma yi sutura da fatar akuya a wuyansa da hanuwansa.

Jacob came to Isaac and said, "I am Esau. I have come so that you can bless me." When Isaac felt the goat hair and smelled the clothes, he thought it was Esau and blessed him.

Yakubu ya taho wurin Ishaƙu ya ce:" Ni ne Isuwa. Na zo domin ka sa mini albarka." Da Ishaƙu ya shafi gashin akuya, ya kuma shinshina kayan jikin, sai yayi tsammani Isuwa ne, sai ya sa masa albarka.

Esau hated Jacob because Jacob had stolen his rights as oldest son and also his blessing. So he planned to kill Jacob after their father died.

Isuwa ya husata domin Yakubu ya sace masa matsayinsa na ɗan fari da kuma albarkarsa. Sai ya ƙudura ya kashe Yakubu bayan mutuwar ubansu.

But Rebekah heard of Esau's plan. So she and Isaac sent Jacob far away to live with her relatives.

Amma Rifkatu ta ji labarin ƙudurin Isuwa. Sai ita da Ishaƙu suka aiki Yakubu nesa zuwa gidan ubanninta.

Jacob lived with Rebekah's relatives for many years. During that time he married and had twelve sons and a daughter. God made him very wealthy.

Yakubu ya zauna a gidan ƴan'uwan Rifkatu shekaru dayawa. A lokancin nan yayi aure, ya kuma haifi ƴaƴa maza goma sha biyu da ɗiya mace guda.

After twenty years away from his home in Canaan, Jacob returned there with his family, his servants, and all his herds of animals.

Bayan shekara ashirin a waje da gidansa na Kana'ana, Yakubu ya koma tare da iyalinsa, da barorinsa, da dukan garkunan dabbobinsa.

Jacob was very afraid because he thought Esau still wanted to kill him. So he sent many herds of animals to Esau as a gift. The servants who brought the animals said to Esau, "Your servant, Jacob, is giving you these animals. He is coming soon."

Yakubu ya cika da tsoro diyawa domin yana tsammani Isuwa yana so ya kashe shi har yanzu. Sai ya aike da gakunan dabbibi dayawa Kyauta domin Isuwa. Baran da ya kawo da kyautar ya cewa Isuwa:" Baranka Yakubu yake baka waɗannan dabbobin. Yana zuwa da sauri."

But Esau had already forgiven Jacob, and they were happy to see each other again. Jacob then lived peacefully in Canaan. Then Isaac died, and Jacob and Esau buried him. The covenant promises God had promised to Abraham now passed on from Isaac to Jacob.

//A Bible story from: Genesis 25:27-33:20//

//Amma Isuwa ya riga ya gafurtawa Yakubu, sai suka ji daɗin sake saduwa. Yakubu ya zauna hankali kwance a Kana'ana. Sai Ishaƙu//

//ya rasu, Yakubu da Isuwa suka binne shi. Alkarin da Allah yayi wa Ibrahim ya koma daga kan Ishaƙu zuwa kan Yakubu.//
