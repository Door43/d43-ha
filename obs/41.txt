After the soldiers crucified Jesus, the unbelieving Jewish leaders said to Pilate, "That liar, Jesus, said he would rise from the dead after three days. Someone must guard the tomb to make sure that his disciples do not steal the body and then say he has risen from the dead."

Bayan da sojoji suka giciye Yesu, shugabannin Yahudawa da ba su bada gaskiya ba, suka cewa Bilatus:" Maƙaryacin nan Yesu, ya ce zai tashi daga mattatu bayan kwana uku. Ya kamata wani ya tsare kushewar don kadda almajiransa su sace jikin, kuma su ce ya tashi daga mattatu".

Pilate said, "Take some soldiers and make the tomb as secure as you can." So they placed a seal on the stone at the entrance of the tomb and put the soldiers there to make sure no one could steal the body.

Bilatus ya ce:" Ɗauki waɗansu sojoji, kuma su tsare kushewar yadda suke iyawa". Sai suka ɗaure wurin bisan dutse a ƙofar kabari, kuma suka sa sojoji tsaro don su tabbata ba wanda zai sace jikin.

The day after Jesus was buried was a Sabbath day, and the Jews were not permitted to go to a tomb on that day. So very early on the morning after the Sabbath day, several women prepared to go to Jesus' tomb to put more burial spices on his body.

Ranar bayan da aka bizne Yesu ran Asabar ce, Yahudawa ba su da izinin zuwa kabari wannan ranar. Sai da asuba bayan ranar Asabar, mata da yawa suka shirya zuwa kabarin Yesu don su sa kayan ƙamshi na jana'iza kan jikinshi.

Suddenly, there was a great earthquake. An angel that shone as bright as lightning appeared from heaven. He rolled away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb and sat on it. The soldiers guarding the tomb were terrified and fell to the ground like dead men.

Ba zato ba tsammani sai aka yi girgizar ƙasa. Wani mala'ika mai haske kamar walƙiya ya bullo daga sama. Ya ture dutsen da yake rufe kofar kabari, kuma ya zauna a bisan dutsen. Sojojin da suke tsaron kabarin suka tsorota har suka faɗi a ƙasa kamar mattatu.

When the women arrived at the tomb, the angel told them, "Do not be afraid. Jesus is not here. He has risen from the dead, just like he said he would! Look in the tomb and see." The women looked into the tomb and saw where Jesus' body had been laid. His body was not there !

Da matan suka iso kabarin, mala'ikan ya ce masu:" Kadda ku ji tsoro. Yesu ba ya nan.Ya tashi daga mattatu kamar yadda ya faɗa zai yi! Ku duba kabarin ku gani". Matan suka duba cikin kabarin suka ga inda jikin Yesu ya kwanta. Jikin ba ya nan!

Then the angel told the women, "Go and tell the disciples, 'Jesus has risen from the dead and he will go to Galilee ahead of you.'"

Mala'ikan ya cewa matan:" Ku je ku faɗawa almajiran,' Yesu ya tashi daga mattatu, kuma zai je Galili gaba da ku".

The women were full of fear and great joy. They ran to tell the disciples the good news.

Matan suka cika da tsoro da kuma babbar murna. Sai suka yi gudu suka faɗawa almajiran labari mai daɗi.

As the women were on their way to tell the disciples the good news, Jesus appeared to them, and they worshiped him. Jesus said, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my disciples to go to Galilee. They will see me there."

//A Bible story from: Matthew 27:62-28:15; Mark 16:1-11; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-18 //

//Sa'adda matan suke tafiya domin su ba almajiran labarin mai daɗi, Yesu ya bayana garesu, kuma sai suka yi masa sujada. Yesu ya ce:" Kadda ku ji tsoro. Ku je ku faɗa wa almajiraina su tafi Galili. Can za su ganni".//
