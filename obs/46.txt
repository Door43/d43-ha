Saul was the young man who guarded the robes of the men who killed Stephen. He did not believe in Jesus, and so he persecuted the believers. He went from house to house in Jerusalem to arrest both men and women and to put them in prison. The high priest gave Saul permission to go to the city of Damascus to arrest Christians there and to bring them back to Jerusalem.

Shawulu shine saurayin da ya riƙe rigunan mutanen da suka kashe Istifanas. Ba ya gaskanta da Yesu ba, sai ya tsanantawa masu bi. Ya je gida zuwa gida a Urshalima don ya kama duk maza da mata, kuma ya sa su cikin kaso. Babban firist ya baiwa Shawulu izinin ya je garin Dimascus ya kama krista can kuma ya maido su Urshalima.

While Saul was on his way to Damascus, a bright light from heaven shone all around him, and he fell to the ground. Saul heard someone say, "Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?" Saul asked, "Who are you, Master?" Jesus replied to him, "I am Jesus. You are persecuting me!"

Sa'adda Shawulu yake kan hanya zuwa Dimashƙu, haske mai ƙarfi daga sama ya haskaka kewaye da shi, sai kuwa ya faɗi ƙasa. Shawulu ya ji wani yana cewa:" Shawulu! Shawulu! don me kake tsananta mini" Shawulu ya tambaya:" Wanene kai Malam? Yesu ya amsa masa:" Ni ne Yesu. Kana tsananta mini!"

When Saul got up, he could not see. His friends had to lead him into Damascus. Saul did not eat or drink anything for three days.

Da Shawulu ya tashi, ba ya gani. Abokansa suka ja masa gora zuwa Dimashƙu. Shawulu bai ci bai sha ba har kwana uku.

There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. God said to him, "Go to the house where Saul is staying. Place your hands on him so that he can see again." But Ananias said, "Master, I have heard how this man has persecuted the believers." God answered him, "Go! I have chosen him to declare my name to the Jews and to people from other people groups. He will suffer many things for my name."

Akwai wani almajiri a Dimashƙu mai suna Hananiya. Allah ya ce masa:" Je gidan inda Shawulu yake, Ɗaura masa hannuwa domin ya samu ganin gari kuma". Amma Hananias ya ce:" Malam, na ji yadda wannan mutumen ya tsanantawa masu bi". Allah ya amsa masa:" Je ka! Na zaɓe shi ya shaidawa Yahudawa da mutanen wasu kabilu sunana. Zai sha wahalar abu da yawa sabili da sunana".

So Ananias went to Saul, placed his hands on him, and said, "Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, sent me to you so that you can regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." Saul immediately was able to see again, and Ananias baptized him. Then Saul ate some food and his strength returned.

Sai Hanania ya je wurin Shawulu, ya ɗaura masa hannuwa, kuma ya ce:" Yesu, da ya bayyana gareka a hanya zuwa nan, ya aiko ni wurinka don sami ganin gari, kuma ka cika da Ruhu Mai Tsarki". Shawulu nan da nan ya samu ganin gari, kuma Hananias ya yi masa basftisma. Sai Shawulu ya ci ɗan abinci, kuma sai ƙarfin shi ya dawo.

Right away, Saul began preaching to the Jews in Damascus, saying, "Jesus is the Son of God!" The Jews were amazed that the man who had tried to destroy the believers now also believed in Jesus! Saul reasoned with the Jews, proving that Jesus was the Messiah.

Nan take Shawulu ya fara wa'azi ga Yahudawa a Dimashƙu cewa:" Yesu Ɗan Allah ne!" Yahudawa suka yi mamaki cewa da mutumen da ya so ya hallaka masu bi, yanzu shima ya bada gaskiya ga Yesu! Shawulu ya kwatamta wa Yahudawa Yesu ne Almasihu.

After many days, the Jews made a plan to kill Saul. They sent people to watch for him at the city gates in order to kill him. But Saul heard about the plan, and his friends helped him escape. One night they lowered him over the city wall in a basket. After Saul escaped from Damascus, he continued to preach about Jesus.

Bayan kwanaki da yawa, Yahudawa suka tsara su kashe Shawulu. Sai suka aika mutane su tarbe shi a ƙofofin garin don su kashe shi. Amma Shawulu ya ji labarin dabarar, kuma abokansa suka taya shi ya tsira. Wani dare suka sauko shi cikin kwando da igiya daga katangar garin. Bayan da Shawulu ya kuɓuta daga Dimashƙu, ya ci gaba da wa'azi a kan Yesu.

Saul went to Jerusalem to meet with the disciples, but they were afraid of him. Then a believer named Barnabas took Saul to the apostles and told them how Saul had preached boldly in Damascus. After that, the disciples accepted Saul.

Shawulu ya tafi Urshalima don ya gana da almajiran, amma sun ji tsoronsa. Sai wani mai bi mai sunan Barnabas ya kai Shawulu wurin manzanni, kuma ya faɗa masu yadda Shawulu ya yi wa'azi gagarumi cikin Dimashƙu. Bayan wannan, almajiran suka ƙarɓi Shawulu.

Some believers who fled from the persecution in Jerusalem went far away to the city of Antioch and preached about Jesus. Most of the people in Antioch were not Jews, but for the first time, very many of them also became believers. Barnabas and Saul went there to teach these new believers more about Jesus and to strengthen the church. It was at Antioch that believers in Jesus were first called "Christians."

Wasu masu bi da suka gudu daga tsanani cikin Urshalima suka tafi nesa zuwa wani gari Antakiya, kuma suka yi wa'azi a kan Yesu. Yawancin mutanen Antakiya ba Yahudawa ba ne, amma a karin fari, da yawa daga cikinsu kuwa suka bada gaskiya. Barnabas da Shawulu suka tafi can su koyas da sabobin tuba a kan Yesu, kuma su ƙarfafa Ekklizia. A Antakiya ne masu bin Yesu aka fara kiransu " Krista".

One day, while the Christians at Antioch were fasting and praying, the Holy Spirit said to them, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do the work I have called them to do." So the church in Antioch prayed for Barnabas and Saul and placed their hands on them. Then they sent them out to preach the good news about Jesus in many other places. Barnabas and Saul taught people from different people groups, and many people believed in Jesus.

//Wata rana, sa'adda krista a Antakiya suke azumi da addu'a, Ruhu Mai Tsarki ya ce masu:" ku keɓe mani Barnabas da Shawulu su yi aikin da na aike su, su yi". Sai Ekklisiya cikin Antakiya suka yi addu'a domin Barnabas da Shawulu, kuma suka ɗaura masu hannuwa. Sai suka aike su, su yi wa'azin bisharar Yesu a waɗansu wurare da yawa.
