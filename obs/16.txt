After Joshua died, the Israelites disobeyed God and did not drive out the rest of the Canaanites or obey God's laws. The Israelites began to worship the Canaanite gods instead of Yahweh, the true God. The Israelites had no king, so everyone did what they thought was right for them.

Bayan da Joshuwa ya mutu, Isra'ilawa  suka yi wa Allah rashin biyyaya, kuma basu kori sauran kan'aniyawa da suke a ƙasar ba. Sai Isra'ilawa suka fara bauta wa allolin kan'aniyawa maimakon Yahweh, Allah na gaskiya. Isra'ilawa ba su da sarki a lokacin nan, kenan kowa yana yin abin da ya dama.

Because the Israelites kept disobeying God, he punished them by allowing their enemies to defeat them. These enemies stole things from the Israelites, destroyed their property, and killed many of them. After many years of disobeying God and being oppressed by their enemies, the Israelites repented and asked God to rescue them.

Sabili da Isra'ilawa sun ci gaba da take dokokin Allah, Ya hore su ta wurin barin ƴaƴan gaba su ci nasara a kansu. Wannan ƴaƴan gaban suka sace abubuwan isra'ilawa, suka hallaka gidajensu, suka kashe dayawa daga cikinsu.

Bayan shekaru da dama na tawaye ga Allah da kuma zama a ƙalƙashin ƴaƴan gaba, Isra'ilawa sun tuba, kuma suka roki Allah ya cece su.

Then God provided a deliverer who rescued them from their enemies and brought peace to the land. But then the people forgot about God and started worshiping idols again. So God allowed the Midianites, a nearby enemy people group, to defeat them.

Sai Allah ya tanada masu mai fansa wanda ya cece su daga ƴaƴan gabansu, ya kuma kawo salama cikin ƙasar. Amma mutanen suka manta da Allah hallo, kuma sai suka shiga bautar gumaka. Sai Allah ya sa Madayanawa, kabila ƴaƴan gaba a kusansu, suka ci su da yaƙi.

The Midianites took all of the Israelites' crops for seven years. The Israelites were so scared; they hid in caves so the Midianites would not find them. Finally, they cried out to God to save them.

Madiniyawan suka ɗauki dukan girbin Isra'ilawa na shekara bakwai. Isra'ilawan sun tsorota sarai har suka ɓuya cikin kogon duwatsu inda Madiniyawan ba za su same su ba. A ƙarshe sai suka yi ƙara ga Allah don ya cece su.

One day, a man of Israel named Gideon was threshing grain secretly so the Midianites would not steal it. The angel of Yahweh came to Gideon and said, "God is with you, mighty warrior. Go and save Israel from the Midianites."

Wata rana, wani mutumen Isra'ila mai suna gidiyon yana susukar alkama daga ɓoye don kadda Madayanawa su sace mashi. Mala'ikan Yahweh ya zo gun Gidiyon ya ce:" Allah na tare da kai, babban jarumi. Je ka ka ceci Isra'ila daga Madayanawa.

Gideon's father had an altar dedicated to an idol. God told Gideon to tear down that altar. But Gideon was afraid of the people, so he waited until nighttime. Then he tore down the altar and smashed it to pieces. He built a new altar to God near where the altar to the idol used to be and made a sacrifice to God on it.

Baban Gidiyon yana da bagadi domin gumki. Allah ya faɗa wa Gidiyon ya rushe wannan bagadin. Amma Gidiyon yana jin tsoron mutane, sai ya bari dare yayi. Sai ya rushe bagadin, ya kuma ragolgwaje shi. Ya sake gina sabon bagadi na Allah kusan na gumkin, ya miƙa hadaya ga Allah bisanshi.

The next morning the people saw that someone had torn down and destroyed the altar, and they were very angry. They went to Gideon's house to kill him, but Gideon's father said, "Why are you trying to help your god? If he is a god, let him protect himself!" Because he said this, the people did not kill Gideon.

Da safiya ta waye mutane suka ga wani ya rushe, ya hallaka bagadin, sai suka husata sarai. Sai suka je gidan Gidiyon don su kashe shi, amma baban Gidiyon ya ce:" Me ya sa ku ke ƙoƙari ku taimaki allahnku? In shi allah ne ya ceci kansa mana! Domin ya faɗi wannan, mutanen basu kashe Gidiyon ba.

Then the Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites. There were so many of them that they could not be counted. Gideon called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked God for two signs so he could be sure that God would use him to save Israel.

Sai Madayanawa suka komo su yi wa Isra'ilawa sata. Su da yawa ne har sun fi gaban ƙirge. Gidiyon ya kira Isra'ilawa tare don su yaƙe su. Gidiyon ya roƙi Allah ya gwada masa alamu biyu don ya tabbata da cewa lalle Allah zai yi anfani da shi ya ceci Isra'ila.

For the first sign, Gideon laid a cloth on the ground and asked God to let the morning dew fall only on the cloth and not on the ground. God did that. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too. These two signs convinced Gideon that God would use him to save Israel from the Midianites.

Domin alama ta fari, Gidiyon ya shinfiɗa zane a ƙasa, kuma ya roƙi Allah ya bar raɓar safe ta rufe zanen ƙaɗai, kadda ta rufe ƙasa. Allah yayi haka. Dare mai zuwa, Ya yi roƙo ƙasar ta jiƙe amma banda zanen. Allah ya yi haka kuma. Wadannan alamu biyu sun sa Gidiyon ya yarda da cewa Allah zai yi anfani da shi ya ceci Isra'ila daga Madayanawa.

32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon, but God told him this was too many. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were afraid to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home except for 300 soldiers.

Sojojin isra'ilawa 32,000 suka zo gun Gidiyon, amma Allah ya shaida masa sun yi yawa. Sai Gidiyon ya kori 22,000 da suke jin tsoron yaƙi. Allah ya kuwa cewa Gidiyon sun dai yi yawa har yanzu. Sai Gidiyon ya ƙara korar su sai sauran sojoji 300.

That night God told Gideon, "Go down to the Midianite camp and when you hear what they say, you will no longer be afraid." So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about something he had dreamed. The man's friend said, "This dream means that Gideon's army will defeat the Midianite army!" When Gideon heard this, he worshiped God.

Da dare, Allah ya cewa Gidiyon:" Sabka cikin zangon Madayanawa, idan ka ji abin da suke cewa, ba za ƙara jin tsoro ba". Sai wannan daren, Gidiyon ya sabka zangon, kuma ya ji abin da wani sojin Madayanawa yake gayawa abokinsa a kan mafalkinsa. Abokin mutumen ya ce:" Wannan mafalkin yana nufin sojojin Gidiyon za su ci Madayanawa da yaƙi!" Da Gidiyon ya ji wannan, sai ya yabi Allah.

Then Gideon returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a horn, a clay pot, and a torch. They surrounded the camp where the Midianite soldiers were sleeping. Gideon's 300 men soldiers had the torches in the pots so the Midianites could not see the light of the torches.

Sai Gidiyon ya koma wurin sojojinsa ya baiwa kowanensu ƙafo, da tulun laka, da jiniya. Sai suka kewaye sansanin ind sojoji Madayanawa suke barci. Mutanen Gidiyon 300 ɗin suna riƙe da jiniyoyin a cikin tulun don Madayanawa kar su ga hasken jiniyoyin.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-13.jpg?direct&}}

Then, all of Gideon's soldiers broke their pots at the same moment, suddenly revealing the fire of the torches. They blew their horns and shouted, "A sword for Yahweh and for Gideon!"

Sai dukan sojojin Gidiyon suka kashe tulunan nasu gami guda, nan da nan sai hasken wutar jiniyar ya tashi. Suka busa ƙafo, suka yi ƙara:" Takobi don Yahweh kuma don Gidiyon!"

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-14.jpg?direct&}}

God confused the Midianites, so that they started attacking and killing each other. Immediately, the rest of the Israelites were called from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of the Israelites' land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had saved Israel.

Allah ya rikita Madayanawa, sai suka fara faɗa ma junansu, kuma suka kashe kansu.Nan da nan sauran Isra'ilawa aka kira su daga gidajensu, su zo su taimaka a kori Madayanawa. Suka kashe dayawa daga cikinsu, kuma suka kori sauran waje da ƙasar Isra'ilawa. Madayanawa 120,000 suka mutu wannan rana. Allah ya ceci Isra'ila.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-15.jpg?direct&}}

The people wanted to make Gideon their king. Gideon did not allow them to do this, but he asked them for some of the gold rings that each of them had taken from the Midianites. The people gave Gideon a large amount of gold.

Mutanen suka so su naɗa Gidiyon sarkinsu. Gidiyon bai yardar masu hakanan ba, amma ya tambaye su zoben zinariya da kowanen su ya ɗauke daga Madayanawa. Mutanen suka ba Gidiyon zinariya da yawa.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-16.jpg?direct&}}

Then Gideon used the gold to make a special garment like the high priest used to wear. But the people started worshiping it as if it were an idol. So God punished Israel again because they worshiped idols. God allowed their enemies to defeat them. They finally asked God for help again, and God sent them another deliverer.

Gidiyon ya yi anfani da zinariya ya ɗumka keɓeɓɓen sutura kamar na babban firist. Amma mutanen suka fara yi masa sujada kamar gumki. Sai Allah ya sake hukunta Isra'ila domin bautar gumaka. Allah ya bar ƴaƴan gabansu su ci su da yaƙi. Sai suka roƙi taimakon Allah, kuma Allah ya aike masu da wani mai fansa.

This pattern repeated many times: the Israelites would sin, God would punish them, they would repent, and God would send a deliverer to save them. Over many years, God sent many deliverers who saved the Israelites from their enemies.

Wannan hali ya faru sau da yawa: Isra'ilawa su yi zunubi, Allah ya hore su, su tuba, kuma Allah sai ya aike masu mai fansa ya cece su. Shekaru da yawa Allah ya aike da masu fansa don ceton Isra'ilawa daga abokan gabansu.

Finally, the people asked God for a king like all the other nations had. They wanted a king who was tall and strong, and who could lead them into battle. God did not like this request, but he gave them a king just as they had asked.

//A Bible story from: Judges 1-3; 6-8//

//A ƙarshe, mutanen sun roƙi Allah ya ba su sarki kamar sauran al'ummai. Suna bikatar sarki mai tsawo, kuma mai ƙarfi, wanda yake iya jagorancin su ciki yaƙi. Allah bai ji daɗin wannan roƙo ba, amma ya ba su sarkin kamar yadda suka tambaya.//
