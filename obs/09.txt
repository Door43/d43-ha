After Joseph died, all of his relatives stayed in Egypt. They and their descendants continued to live there for many years and had many children. They were called the Israelites.

Bayan mutuwar Yusufu, dukan ƴan'uwansa suka zauna a Masar. Su da zuriyarsu suka ci gaba da zama shakaru da yawa har suka haifi ƴaƴa da yawa. Ana kiransu Isra'ilawa.

After hundreds of years, the number of Israelites had become very large. The Egyptians no longer remembered Joseph and all he had done to help them. They became afraid of the Israelites because there were so many of them. So the Pharaoh who was ruling Egypt at that time made the Israelites slaves to the Egyptians.

Bayan shekaru ɗaruruwa, yawan isra'ilawa ya ƙaru sosai. Masarawa sun manta da Yusufu da duk abin da ya yi na taimakonsu. Sun ji tsoron isra'ilawa don sun riɓanɓanya. Sai Fir'auna da yake iko a wannan lokacin ya maida Isra'ilawan bayin masarawa.

The Egyptians forced the Israelites to build many buildings and even whole cities. The hard work made their lives miserable, but God blessed them, and they had even more children.

Masarawan suka sa isra'ilawan su yi gini-gine har da ɗumbin garuruwa. Aikin ma wuya ya tsanantawa rayuwarsu, amma Allah ya albarkace su, sai suka ƙara haifuwar ƴaƴa.

Pharaoh saw that the Israelites were having many babies, so he ordered his people to kill all Israelite baby boys by throwing them into the Nile River.

Fir'auna ya ga isra'ilawa suna ta samu haufuwa dayawa, sai ba mutanensa umarni su kashe dukkan jarirai maza na isra'ilawa, ta jeffa su cikin ruwan Nilu.

A certain Israelite woman gave birth to a baby boy. She and her husband hid the baby for as long as they could.

Wata macen Isra'ila ta haifi ɗa namiji. Ita da mijinta sun ɓoye yaron tsawon lokacin da suke iyawa.

When the boy's parents could no longer hide him, they put him in a floating basket among the reeds along the edge of the Nile River in order to save him from being killed. His older sister watched to see what would happen to him.

Sa'ada uwayen yaron ba su iya ɓoye shi, sai suka sa shi cikin kwando bisan ruwa cikin kyauro a bakin kogin Nilu don ta cece shi daga makasa. ƴar'uwarsa tana lura ta gani abin da zai faru da shi.

A daughter of Pharaoh saw the basket and looked inside. When she saw the baby, she took him as her own son. She hired an Israelite woman to nurse him without realizing the woman was the baby's own mother. When the child was old enough that he no longer needed his mother's milk, she returned him to Pharaoh's daughter, who named him Moses.

Gimbiya ƴar Fir'auna ta ga kwandon, kuma ta duba ciki. Da ta gani jariri ne, ta ɗauke shi kamar ɗanta na cikinta.Ta ɗauki mace bayahudiya ta yi renon shi, ba ta san da cewa ba macen ita ce uwar yaron ta gaskiya. Da yaron ya girma an yaye shi, ta maida wa ƴar Fir'auna, ita kwa ta kira sunansa Musa.

One day, when Moses had grown up, he saw an Egyptian beating an Israelite slave. Moses tried to save his fellow Israelite.

Wata rana lokacin da Musa yayi girma. ya gani wani bamasare yana bugon bayahude bawa. Musa ya yi ƙoƙari ya ceci ɗanuwansa bayahude.

When Moses thought nobody would see, he killed the Egyptian and buried his body. But someone saw what Moses had done.

Da Musa ya ga ba mai ganinshi, sai ya kashe bamasaren, ya kuma binne jikinsa. Amma akwai wanda ya ga duk abin da Musa yayi.

When Pharaoh heard what Moses had done, he tried to kill him. Moses ran away from Egypt to the wilderness where he would be safe from Pharaoh's soldiers.

Da Fir'auna ya ji labarin abin da Musa ya yi, sai ya so ya kashe shi. Musa ya gudu daga Masar zuwa cikin jeji inda ya kuɓuta daga hannun sojojin Fir'auna.

Moses became a shepherd in the wilderness far away from Egypt. He married a woman from that place and had two sons.

Musa ya zama makiyayi cikin jeji nessa da Masar. Ya auri mata a wannan wuri, ya haifi ɗiya biyu.

One day while Moses was taking care of his sheep, he saw a bush that was on fire. But the bush did not burn up. Moses went towards the bush to be able to see it better. As he approached the burning bush, the voice of God said, "Moses, take off your shoes. You are standing on holy ground."

Wata rana sa'ada Musa yake kiwon tumakinsa, ya ga kurmi yana cin wuta. Amma kurmin bai ƙone ba. Musa ya kusato da kurmin don ya gani da kyau. Da ya matso kusan kurmin mai cin wuta, sai muryar Allah ta ce:" Musa, fidda takalmanka. Wurin da kake mai tsarki ne".

God said, "I have seen the suffering of my people. I will send you to Pharaoh so that you can bring the Israelites out of their slavery in Egypt. I will give them the land of Canaan, the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."

Allah ya ce:" Na ga wahalar mutanena. Zan aike ka wurin Fir'auna don ka fitar da isra'ilawa daga bautarsu daga cikin Masar. Zan basu ƙasar Kan'ana, ƙasar da na wa Ibrahim, Ishaƙu, da Yakubu alkawali.

Moses asked, "What if the people want to know who sent me, what should I say?" God said, "I AM WHO I AM. Tell them, 'I AM has sent me to you.' Also tell them, 'I am Yahweh, the God of your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' This is my name forever."

Musa yayi tambaya:" In mutane suka tambaya wa ya aiko ni, me zan ce?" Allah ya ce:" NI NE WANDA YAKE NI NE. Ka ce masu Ni ne ya aiko ni wurinku. Ka kuma gaya masu Ni ne Yahweh, Allah kakanninku Ibrahim, Ishaƙu da Yakubu. Wannan sunana ne har abada.

Moses was afraid and did not want to go to Pharaoh because he thought he could not speak well, so God sent Moses' brother, Aaron, to help him. God warned Moses and Aaron that Pharaoh would be stubborn.

//A Bible story from: Exodus 1-4//

//Musa ya tsorota kuma ba ya so ya je wajen Fir'auna ba don yana tunanin ba zai iya magana ba da kyau, sai Allah ya aiko da ɗanuwan Musa, Haruna, don ya taimake shi. Allah ya faɗakar da Musa da Haruna cewa da Fir'auna zai taurare zuciyarsa.//
