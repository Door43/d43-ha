Many years later, when Jacob was an old man, he sent his favorite son, Joseph, to check on his brothers who were taking care of the herds.

Bayan shekaru da dama, loton da Yakubu ya zama tsohon mutun, ya aike da ƙaunatacen ɗansa Yusufu, ya duba ƴan'uwansa da suke kiwon garkensu.

Joseph's brothers hated him because their father loved him most and because Joseph had dreamed that he would be their ruler. When Joseph came to his brothers, they kidnapped him and sold him to some slave traders.

Ƴan'uwan Yusufu suna kishinshi sabili da ubansu ya fi ƙaunarsa, kuma sabili da Yusufu yayi mafalki zai zama mai ikonsu.

Da Yusufu ya zo wurin ƴan'uwan sai suka kama shi suka saiyar da shi ga masu saiyar da bayi.

Before Joseph's brothers returned home, they tore Joseph's robe and dipped it in goat's blood. Then they showed the robe to their father so he would think that a wild animal had killed Joseph. Jacob was very sad.

Kafin ƴan'uwan Yusufu su koma gida sai suka cira rigar Yusufu, suka jiƙa ta da jinin akduya. Sai suka gwada wa uban rigar don yayi zaton cewa da dabbar daji ta kashe Yusufu. Yakubu yayi baƙin ciki sosai.

The slave traders took Joseph to Egypt. Egypt was a large, powerful country located along the Nile River. The slave traders sold Joseph as a slave to a wealthy government official. Joseph served his master well, and God blessed Joseph.

Masu sayar da bayi suka kai Yusufu Masar. Masar, ƙasa ce mai faɗi, mai mulki, tana jikin ruwan Nilu.Masu sayar da bayi suka saida Yusufu kamar bawa ga wani mai arziki, ma'aikacin gomnati. Yusufu ya bauta mashi da kyau, sai Allah ya albarkace shi.

His master's wife tried to sleep with Joseph, but Joseph refused to sin against God in this way. She became angry and falsely accused Joseph so that he was arrested and sent to prison. Even in prison, Joseph remained faithful to God, and God blessed him.

Matar maigidanshi ta jaraba ta kwana da Yusufu, amma Yusufu bai yarda yayi ma Allah zunubi haka ba. Ta husata sai ta zargi Yusufu har an kama shi a kurkuku. Ko a kaso Yusufu ya dogara ga Allah, sai Allah ya albarkace shi.

After two years, Joseph was still in prison, even though he was innocent. One night, the Pharaoh, which is what the Egyptians called their kings, had two dreams that disturbed him greatly. None of his advisors could tell him the meaning of the dreams.

Bayan shekara biyu, Yusufu yana dai cikin kurkuku, ko da yake maras laifi ne. Wani dare, Fir'auna, wanda masarawa ke kira sarkinsu, yayi mafalki biyu da suka tada hankalinsa. Ba mashawartansa ko guda da ya iya bashi fasarar mafalkin.

God had given Joseph the ability to interpret dreams, so Pharaoh had Joseph brought to him from the prison. Joseph interpreted the dreams for him and said, "God is going to send seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by seven years of famine."

Allah ya baiwa Yusufu fasarar mafalkai, sai Fir'auna ya sa aka fito da Yusufu daga kaso. Yusufu ya fasarta mafalkai ya ce:"Allah zai aiko da shekara bakwai na yalwar girbi,kuma bayansu shekara bakwai na yunwa".

Pharaoh was so impressed with Joseph that he appointed him to be the second most powerful man in all of Egypt!

Fir'auna ya ƙasaita sosai da Yusufu, sai ya naɗa shi mutun na biyu mai iko a cikin dukan Masar.

Joseph told the people to store up large amounts of food during the seven years of good harvests. Then Joseph sold the food to the people when the seven years of famine came so they would have enough to eat.

Yusufu ya umurci mutane su tanada abinci dayawa lokacin yalwar girbi shekara bakwai. Sai Yusufu ya sayar wa mutane abinci lokacin da shekara bakwai na yunwa suka fara.

The famine was severe not only in Egypt, but also in Canaan where Jacob and his family lived.

Yunwar na da tsanani ba cikin Masar ƙaɗai ba, har a Kana'ana inda Yakubu da iyalinsa suke.

So Jacob sent his older sons to Egypt to buy food. The brothers did not recognize Joseph when they stood before him to buy food. But Joseph recognized them.

Sai Yakubu ya aike da manyan ƴaƴansa Masar don sayan abinci. Ƴan'uwan basu gane Yusufu ba da suka tsaya gabansa wurin

sayan abinci. Amma Yusufu ya gane su.

After testing his brothers to see if they had changed, Joseph said to them, "I am your brother, Joseph! Do not be afraid. You tried to do evil when you sold me as a slave, but God used the evil for good! Come and live in Egypt so I can provide for you and your families."

Bayan ya gwada ƴan'uwansa ya gani ko sun canza hali, Yusufu ya ce masu:" Nine ɗanuwanku Yusufu! Kadda ku ji tsoro. Kun yi zaton yin mugunta da ku ka sayar da ni kamar bawa, amma Allah yayi anfani da wannan yayi alheri! Ku zo ku zauna a Masar sai in taimakeku, ku da iyalinku."

When Joseph's brothers returned home and told their father, Jacob, that Joseph was still alive, he was very happy.

Da ƴan'uwan Yusufu suka koma gida, suka ba ubansu Yakubu, labarin Yusufu yana da rai, ya yi farin ciki.

Even though Jacob was an old man, he moved to Egypt with all of his family, and they all lived there. Before Jacob died, he blessed each of his sons.

Koda yake Yakubu ya tsufa, ya ƙaura zuwa Masar da dukan iyalinsa, sun kuma zauna a can. Kafin Yakubu ya mutu ya albarkaci kowane daga ɗiyansa maza.

The covenant promises that God gave to Abraham were passed on to Isaac, then to Jacob, and then to Jacob's twelve sons and their families. The descendants of the twelve sons became the twelve tribes of Israel.

//A Bible story from: Genesis 37-50//

//Rantsuwar alkawarai da Allah ya baiwa Ibrahim suka hau kan Ishaƙu, kuma Yakubu, kuma kan ƴaƴa goma sha biyu na Yakubu da iyalensu. Zuriyar sha biyun sune suka zama kabilu sha biyu na Isra'ila.//
