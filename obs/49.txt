An angel told a virgin named Mary that she would give birth to God's Son. So while she was still a virgin, she gave birth to a son and named him Jesus. Therefore, Jesus is both God and human.

Wani mala'ika ya fadawa budurwa Maryamu da za ta haifi Ɗan Allah. Sai sa'adda take nan budurwa, ta haifi ɗa, kuma ta, kira sunansa Yesu. Kenan, Yesu shi Allahne kuma mutum ne.

Jesus did many miracles that prove he is God. He walked on water, calmed storms, healed many sick people, drove out demons, raised the dead to life, and turned five loaves of bread and two small fish into enough food for over 5,000 people.

Yesu ya yi al'ajabai da yawa da ya gwada shi Allah ne. Ya yi tafiya a kan ruwa, ya tsayadda iskoki, ya warkas da marasa lafiya da yawa, ya fitar da aljannu da dama, ya tada mattatu da rai, kuma ya juyadda gurasa biyar da kifi biyu cikin abinci issashe domin mutane fiye da 5,000.

Jesus was also a great teacher, and he spoke with authority because he is the Son of God. He taught that you need to love other people the same way you love yourself.

Yesu ya zama babban malami, kuma ya yi magana da iko saboda shi Ɗan Allah ne. Ya koyas da cewa kuna bukata ku ƙaunaci waɗansu mutane kamar yadda ku ke ƙaunar kanku.

He also taught that you need to love God more than you love anything else, including your wealth.

Ya kuma koyas da ku na bukata ku ƙaunaci Allah fiye da komi, har ma da arzikinku.

Jesus said that the kingdom of God is more valuable than anything else in the world. The most important thing for anyone is to belong to the kingdom of God. To enter into God's kingdom, you must be saved from your sin.

Yesu ya ce mulkin Allah ya fi kowane abu tamani a duniya. Abu mafi mahimmanci ga kowa, shine ya zama cikin mulkin Allah. Shiga mulkin Allah, sai ka samu ceto daga zunubin ka.

Jesus taught that some people will receive him and be saved, but others will not. He said that some people are like good soil. They receive the good news of Jesus and are saved. Other people are like the hard soil of a path, where the seed of God's word does not enter and does not produce any harvest. Those people reject the message about Jesus and will not enter into his kingdom.

Yesu ya yi koyaswa cewa da wasu mutane za su ƙarɓe shi, kuma su tsira, amma waɗansu za su ƙiya. Ya faɗa cewa wasu mutane suna kama da ƙasa mai kyau. Sun karɓi bisharar Yesu, kuma sun sami ceto. Waɗansu mutane kuwa suna kama da ƙasa mai tauri cikin hanya, inda ƙwayar maganar Allah ba ta shiga, kuma ba ta bada girbi ba. Mutanen nan suka yadda saƙon Yesu, kuma ba za su shiga mulkinsa ba.

Jesus taught that God loves sinners very much. He wants to forgive them and to make them his children.

Yesu ya koyas da Allah yana ƙaunar masu zunubi sosai. Yana so ya gafarta masu, kuma ya maida su ƴaƴansa.

Jesus also told us that God hates sin. When Adam and Eve sinned, it affected all of their descendants. As a result, every person in the world sins and is separated from God. Therefore, everyone has become an enemy of God.

Yesu ya kuma faɗa mana Allah yana ƙyamar zunubi. Sa'adda Adamu da Hawa'u suka yi zunubi, ya shafi dukan zuriyarsu. Sakamako, kowane mutum mai zunubi ne, kuma a rabe yake da Allah. Kenan kowa ya zama abokin gaba na Allah.

But God loved everyone in the world so much that he gave his only Son so that whoever believes in Jesus will not be punished for his sins, but will live with God forever.

Amma Allah yana ƙaunar kowa a cikin duniya har ya bada  makaɗaicin ɗansa don duk wanda ya gaskanta da Yesu, ba za a hukunta shi ba don zunubainsa, amma zai rayu da Allah har abada.

Because of your sin, you are guilty and deserve to die. God should be angry with you, but he poured out his anger on Jesus instead of on you. When Jesus died on the cross, he received your punishment.

Saboda zunubinku, ku masu laifi ne, kuma kun cancanci mutuwa. Allah ya kamata ya yi fushi da ku, amma ya zuba fushinsa bisan Yesu a madadin ku. Sa'adda Yesu ya mutu a kan giciye, ya karɓi hukuncin ku.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-11.jpg?direct&}}

Jesus never sinned, but he chose to be punished and to die as the perfect sacrifice to take away your sins and the sins of every person in the world. Because Jesus sacrificed himself, God can forgive any sin, even terrible sins.

Yesu bai taɓa yin zunubi ba, amma ya zaɓa ya ɗauki hukunci, kuma ya mutu kamar ingantacciyar hadaya mai kawas da zunubainku da zunubain kowane mutum cikin duniya. Sabili da Yesu ya bada kansa hadaya, Allah yana iya gafarta kowane zunubi, ko zunubi mai tsanani ne.

Good works cannot save you. There is nothing you can do to have a relationship with God. Only Jesus can wash away your sins. You must believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died on the cross instead of you, and that God raised him to life again.

Ayuka masu kyau ba su iya ceton ku. Ba abin da ku ke iyawa don ku sada zumunta da Allah. Yesu kaɗai yake iya wanke zunubainku. Sai kun gaskanta da Yesu shine Ɗan Allah, kuma ya mutu bisan giciye a madadin ku, kuma Allah ya tashe shi da rai.

God will save everyone who believes in Jesus and receives him as their Master. But he will not save anyone who does not believe in him. It does not matter if you are rich or poor, man or woman, old or young, or where you live. God loves you and wants you to believe in Jesus so he can have a close relationship with you.

Allah zai ceci duk wanda ya gaskanta da Yesu, kuma ya karɓe shi kamar Malamin shi. Amma ba zai ceci duk wanda ba ya bada gaskiya ba. Babu damuwa ko kai mai arziki ne ko matalauci ne, ko na miji ko mace, tsofo ko yaro, ko ind kake rayuwa. Allah yana ƙaunarku, kuma yana so ku gaskanta da Yesu don ya yi zumunta da ku.

Jesus invites you to believe in him and to be baptized. Do you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the only Son of God? Do you believe that you are a sinner and that you deserve for God to punish you? Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross to take away your sins?

Yesu yana gayatar ku, ku gaskanta da shi, kuma a yi maku baftisma. Ko kun amince Yesu na Almasihu, makaɗaicin Ɗan Allah? Ko kun amince da ku masu zunubi ne, kuma kun cancanci Allah ya hukunta ku? Ko kun yi imani da cewa Yesu ya mutu kan giciye don ya ɗauki zunubainku?

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-15.jpg?direct&}}

If you believe in Jesus and what he has done for you, you are a Christian! God has taken you out of Satan's kingdom of darkness and put you into God's kingdom of light. God has taken away your old, sinful ways of doing things and has given you new, righteous ways of doing things.

In kun gaskanta da Yesu da kuma abin da ya yi domin ku, ku Krista ne! Allah ya fitar da ku daga mulkin Shaiɗan na duhu, kuma ya sa ku cikin mulkin Allah na haske. Allah ya kawas da tsofuwar hanyar ku ta yin abubuwa, kuma ya ba ku sabuwar hanyar yin abubuwa.

If you are a Christian, God has forgiven your sins because of what Jesus did. Now, God considers you to be a close friend instead of an enemy.

Idan kai Krista ne, Allah ya gafarta maka zunubainka sabili da abin da Yesu ya yi. Yanzu Allah ya ɗauke ka aboki maimakon abokin gaba.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-49-17.jpg?direct&}}

If you are a friend of God and a servant of Jesus the Master, you will want to obey what Jesus teaches you. Even though you are a Christian, you will still be tempted to sin. But God is faithful and says that if you confess your sins, he will forgive you. He will give you strength to fight against sin.

Idan kai abokin Allah ne, kuma bawan Yesu Malami, za ka so ka yi biyyaya da koyaswar Yesu. Ko da yake kai Krista ne, za ka samu jarabawa ta zunubi. Amma Allah amintacce ya ce in ka furta zunubainka, zai gafarta maka. Zai baka ƙarfin yaƙi da zunubi.

God tells you to pray, to study his word, to worship him with other Christians, and to tell others what he has done for you. All of these things help you to have a deeper relationship with him.
