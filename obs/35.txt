One day, Jesus was teaching many tax collectors and other sinners who had gathered to hear him.

Wata rana Yesu yana koyas da masu ƙarɓar haraji da yawa, kuma masu zunubi da suka taru su saurare shi.

Some religious leaders who were also there saw Jesus treating these sinners as friends, and they began to criticize him to each other. So Jesus told them this story.

Waɗansu shugabannin addini da suke wurin, suka ga Yesu yana abotaka da masu zunubi, kuma sai suka fara sukanshi ga junansu. Sai Yesu ya faɗa masu wannan labari.

"There was a man who had two sons. The younger son told his father, 'Father, I want my inheritance now!' So the father divided his property between his two sons."

" Akwai wani mutum mai ɗiya maza biyu. Ƙaramin ɗan ya cewa mahaifinsa:" Baba, ina son dukan gadona yanzu!" Sai uban ya raba dukiyarsa tsakanin ƴaƴan maza biyu".

"Soon the younger son gathered all that he had and went far away and wasted his money in sinful living."

"Nan take ƙaramin ɗan ya tattara duk abin da yake da, kuma ya yi tafiya mai nisa, can ya kashe kuɗinsa cikin mugunyar rayuwa".

"After that, a severe famine happened in the land where the younger son was, and he had no money to buy food. So he took the only job he could find, feeding pigs. He was so miserable and hungry that he wanted to eat the pigs' food."

" Bayan wannan, yunwa mai tsanani ta faru a ƙasar inda ƙaramin ɗan yake, kuma ya rasa kuɗin sayan abinci. Sai ya ya ɗauki aikin kaɗai da yake iya samu, cida aladu. Yana cikin matsala da yawa, kuma da yunwa sosai har ya so ya ci abincin aladu".

"Finally, the younger son said to himself, 'What am I doing? All my father's servants have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving. I will go back to my father and ask to be one of his servants.'"

" A ƙarshe, ƙaramin ɗan ya cewa kansa:" Me kenan nake yi? Dukan ma'aikatan ubana suna da abinci isashe, ga ni nan ina yunwa. Zan koma wurin mahaifina in tambaye shi in zama ɗaya daga cikin barorinsa".

"So the younger son started back towards his father's home. When he was still far away, his father saw him and felt compassion for him. He ran to his son and hugged him and kissed him."

" Sai ƙaramin ɗan ya koma tafiya zuwa gidan mahaifinsa. Daga nesa, uban ya tsinkaye shi, kuma ya ji juyayinshi. Ya gudu zuwa wurin ɗansa, kuma ya rungume shi, ya kuwa sumbace shi".

"The son said, 'Father, I have sinned against God and against you. I am not worthy to be your son.'"

" Ɗan ya ce:" Baba, na yi maka zunubi, na kuma yi wa Allah zunubi. Ban cancanta in zama ɗanka ba".

"But his father told one of his servants, 'Go quickly and bring the best clothes and put them on my son! Put a ring on his finger and put sandals on his feet. Then kill the best calf so we can have a feast and celebrate, because my son was dead, but now he is alive! He was lost, but now he is found!'"

" Amma mahaifinsa ya faɗawa barorinsa:" Ku je maza ku kawo kayan jiki mafi kyau, kuma ku sawa ɗana! Ku sanya masa zobe a yatsa, kuma ku sa masa takalma a ƙafafuwansa. Ku yanka ɗan maraƙe mafi kyau don mu yi salla, mu yi murna domin ɗana ya mutu, amma yanzu yana da rai! Ya ɓata, amma yanzu ya samu!"

"So the people began to celebrate. Before long, the older son came home from working in the field. He heard the music and dancing and wondered what was happening."

" Sai mutane suka fara shagali. Ba da daɗewa ba, sai babban ɗan ya dawo daga aikin gona. Ya ji kiɗa da raye-raye, kuma ya tunanin me ya faru".

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-35-11.jpg?direct&}}

"When the older son found out that they were celebrating because his brother had come home, he was very angry and would not go into the house. His father came out and begged him to come and celebrate with them, but he refused."

"Da babban ɗan ya ji shagalin na dawowar ɗanuwansa gidane ne suke yi, sai ya husata, ya ƙi ya shiga cikin gidan. Mahaifinsa ya fito waje, ya roƙe shi ya shigo ya yi murna tare da su, amma sai ya ƙiya".

"The older son said to his father, 'All these years I have worked faithfully for you! I never disobeyed you, and still you did not even give me one small goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who consumed your money in sinful behavior came home, you killed the best calf for him!'"

" Babban ɗan ya cewa mahaifinsa:" Dukan waɗannan shekaru na maka aiki da zuciya ɗaya! Ban taɓa ma rashin biyyaya ba, kuma har yanzu baka taɓa bani ko ƙaramar akuya ba domin in yi shagali da abokaina. Amma da wannan ɗan naka da ya cinye kuɗinka ta wurin muguwar hanya, ya komo gida, ka kashe maraƙi mafi kyau dominshi!"

"The father answered, 'My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But it is right for us to celebrate, because your brother was dead, but now is alive. He was lost, but now is found!'"

//A Bible story from: Luke 15:11-32//

//" Uban ya amsa masa:" Ɗana, kana tare da ni kullum, kuma komi nawa naka ne. Amma daidai ne a gare mu, mu yi salla, domin ɗanuwanka ya mutu, amma yanzu yana da rai. Ya ɓata, amma yanzu ya samu!"//
