When God created the world, everything was perfect. There was no sin. Adam and Eve loved each other, and they loved God. There was no sickness or death. This was the way God wanted the world to be.

Lokacin da Allah ya halici duniya, komi yana da kyau. Babu zunubi. Adamu da Hawa'u suna ƙaunar juna, kuma suna ƙaunar Allah. Babu cuta ko mutuwa. Hakane Allah ya so duniya ta zama.

Satan spoke through the snake in the garden in order to deceive Eve. Then she and Adam sinned against God. Because they sinned, everyone on earth gets sick and everyone dies.

Shaiɗan ya yi magana ta bakin maciji cikin gonar don ya cuci Hawa'u. Sai ita da Adamu suka yi ma Allah zunubi. Domin sun yi zunubi, kowa a duniya yana cuta, kuma kowa yana mutuwa.

Because Adam and Eve sinned, something even more terrible happened. They became enemies of God. As a result, every person since then has been born with a sinful nature and is also an enemy of God. The relationship between God and people was broken by sin. But God had a plan to restore that relationship.

Domin Adamu da Hawa'u sun yi zunubi, wani abu mummuna ya faru. Sun koma abokan gaba Allah. Sakamakon wannan, kowane mutum tun sa'annan, an haife shi cikin zunubi, kuma ya zama abokin gaba na Allah. Zumunci tsakanin Allah da mutane ya baci saboda zunubi. Amma Allah yana da shiri ya gyara wannan zumuncin.

God promised that one of Eve's descendants would crush Satan's head, and Satan would wound his heel. This meant that Satan would kill the Messiah, but God would raise him to life again, and then the Messiah will crush the power of Satan forever. Many years later, God revealed that Jesus is the Messiah.

Allah ya yi alkawali cewa wani zuriyar Hawa'u zai murƙushe kan Shaiɗan, kuma Shaiɗan zai ƙuje dudugensa. Wannan yana nufi da Shaiɗan zai kashe Almasihu, amma Allah zai tashe shi zuwa rai kuma, sa'annan Almasihu zai murƙushe ikon Shaiɗan har abada. Shekaru da dama da suka wuce, Allah ya bayyana da Yesu shine Almasihu.

When God destroyed the whole earth by the flood, he provided the boat to save the people who believed in him. In the same way, everyone deserves to be destroyed because of their sins, but God provided Jesus to save everyone who believes in him.

Sa'adda Allah ya hallaka dukan duniya da ruwa, ya tanada jirgin ruwa don ceton mutanen da suka gaskanta da shi. Ta hakanan, kowa ya cancanci hallaka saboda zunubinsa, amma Allah ya tanada Yesu ya ceci duk wanda ya gaskanta da shi.

For hundreds of years, priests continually offered sacrifices to God for people to show the punishment that they deserved for their sins. But those sacrifices could not take away their sin. Jesus is the Great High Priest. Unlike other priests, he offered himself as the only sacrifice that could take away the sin of all the people in the world. Jesus was the perfect high priest because he took the punishment for every sin that anyone has ever committed.

Shekaru ɗaruruwa baya, priestoci, kulluyomi, suka miƙa hadayu ga Allah domin mutane su gane hukunci da ya cancanta don zunubainsu. Amma waɗannan hadayu ba su iya ɗauke zunubainsu ba.

Yesu ne ingantaccen babban firist saboda ya ɗauki hukunci kowane zunubi da kowa ya aikata.

God told Abraham, "All the people groups of the earth will be blessed through you." Jesus was a descendant of Abraham. All the people groups are blessed through him, because everyone who believes in Jesus is saved from sin, and becomes a spiritual descendant of Abraham.

Allah ya faɗawa Ibrahim:" Dukan kabilun mutane za su sami albarka ta wurinka". Yesu zuriyar Ibrahim ne. Dukan kabilun mutane sun albarkatu ta wurinsa, domin duk wanda yana bada gaskiya ga Yesu, ya sami ceto daga zunubi, kuma ya zama zuriyar ruhaniya ta Ibrahim.

When God told Abraham to offer his son, Isaac, as a sacrifice, God provided a lamb for the sacrifice instead of his son, Isaac. We all deserve to die for our sins! But God provided Jesus, the Lamb of God, as a sacrifice to die in our place.

Sa'adda Allah ya faɗa wa Ibrahim ya miƙa ɗansa Ishaƙu hadaya, Allah ya tanada ɗan rago hadaya a maimakon ɗansa Ishaƙu. Mu duka mun cancanci mutuwa saboda zunubainmu! Amma Allah ya tanada Yesu, Ɗan Ragon Allah, hadaya, ya mutu madadin mu.

When God sent the last plague on Egypt, he told each Israelite family to kill a perfect lamb and spread its blood on the tops and sides of their door frames. When God saw the blood, he passed over their houses and did not kill their firstborn sons. This event is called the Passover.

Lokacin da Allah ya aike da alloba ta ƙarshe a Masar, ya faɗawa kowane iyalin Isra'ila da su kashe ɗan rago maras aibi, kuma su yaɗa jininsa bisan, da gefofin ƙofa. Sa'adda Allah ya gani jinin, sai ya wuce gidan, kuma ba ya kashe ɗiyan farin su maza ba. Wannan yanayi ana kiransa Idin ƙetarewa.

Jesus is our Passover Lamb. He was perfect and sinless and was killed at the time of the Passover celebration. When anyone believes in Jesus, the blood of Jesus pays for that person's sin, and God's punishment passes over that person.

Yesu ne Idin ƙetarewar mu. Ingantacce ne, kuma maras zunubi, kuma aka kashe shi lokacin Idin ƙetarewa. Idan kowa ya gaskanta ga Yesu, jinin Yesu ya biya zunubin mutumen, kuma hukuncin Allah zai wuce kansa.

God made a covenant with the Israelites, who were his chosen people. But God has now made a New Covenant that is available to everyone. Because of this New Covenant, anyone from any people group can become part of God's people by believing in Jesus.

Allah ya yi alkawali da Isra'ilawa, zaɓɓaɓun mutanensa. Amma yanzu, Allah ya yi wani Sabon Alkawali wanda ya dace da kowa. Sabili da wannan Sabon Alkawalin, kowa daga kowace kabila yana iya zama cikin mutanen Allah, ta wurin gaskantawa ga Yesu.

Moses was a great prophet who proclaimed the word of God. But Jesus is the greatest prophet of all. He is God, so everything he did and said were the actions and words of God. That is why Jesus is called the Word of God.

Musa ya zama babban annabin da ya shaida maganar Allah. Amma Yesu ne mafi girma cikin annabawa duka. Shi Allah ne, duk abin da ya yi, ko faɗa, ayukane da maganganu na Allah. Saboda shine ake kiran Yesu Maganar Allah.

God promised King David that one of his descendants would rule as king over God’s people forever. Because Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah, he is that special descendant of David who can rule forever.

Allah ya yi wa Sarki Dauda alkawali cewa ɗaya daga zuriyarsa zai yi mulki kamar sarki bisan mutanen Allah har abada. Domin Yesu Ɗan Allah ne, kuma Almasihu ne, shine wannan zuriya ta ainihi ta Dauda, da take iya mulki har abada.

David was the king of Israel, but Jesus is the king of the entire universe! He will come again and rule his kingdom with justice and peace, forever.
