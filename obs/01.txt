Then God said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. God saw that the light was good and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which he called "night." God created the light on the first day of creation.

Allah ya ce, "Bari haske ya kasance!", sai kuwa ya kasance.  Allah ya ga hasken yana da kyau sai ya kira shi yini. Ya raba shi da duhu, wanda ya kira dare. Allah ya halitta haske a rana ta fari ta halitta.

On the second day of creation, God spoke and created the sky above the earth. He made the sky by separating the water above from the water below.

A rana ta biyu ta halitta, Allah yayi Magana ya halicci sama da ƙasa. Yayi sama ta wurin raba ruwayen sama da ruwayen ƙasa.

On the third day, God spoke and separated the water from the dry land. He called the dry land "earth," and he called the water "seas." God saw that what he had created was good.

A rana ta uku, Allah ya yi Magana sai ya raba ruwaye da bushashiyar ƙasa. Ya kirayi bushashiyar ƙasar, duniya, ruwayen kuma teku. Allah ya gani yana da kyau.

Then God said, "Let the earth produce all kinds of trees and plants." And that is what happened. God saw that what he had created was good.

Sai Allah ya ce: "Bari ƙasa ta fid da tsire-tsire na masu bada tsaba, da itatuwa masu bada 'ya'ya, kowane bisa ga nasa iri". Allah ya gani yana da kyau.

On the fourth day of creation, God spoke and made the sun, the moon, and the stars. God made them to give light to the earth and to mark day and night, seasons and years. God saw that what he had created was good.

A rana ta huɗu ta halitta, Allah ya yi Magana sai ya halicce rana, da wata, da tauraru. Allah ya halicce su don su bada haske ga duniya, su raba yini da dare, lokacin shekara. Allah ya gani yana da kyau.

On the fifth day, God spoke and made everything that swims in the water and all the birds. God saw that it was good, and he blessed them.

A rana ta biyar, Allah ya yi Magana sai ya halicce da kowane irin mai rai cikin ruwaye da duk tsuntsaye. Allah ya gani yana da kyau, sai ya albarkace su.

On the sixth day of creation, God said, "Let there be all kinds of land animals!" And it happened just like God said. Some were farm animals, some crawled on the ground, and some were wild. And God saw that it was good .

A rana ta shida Allah ya ce: "Bari dabbobi iri-iri su kasance a duniya!" Ya kasance kamar yadda Allah ya faɗa. Waɗansu dabbobin gona, waɗansu dabbobi masu rarrafe, waɗansu dabbobin daji. Sai Allah ya ga yana da kyau.

Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have authority over the earth and all the animals."

Sai Allah ya ce:" Bari mu yi mutum cikin siffarmu, da kamanninmu. Shi yi mulkin duniya da dukan dabbobi.

So God took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed life into him. This man's name was Adam. God planted a garden where Adam could live, and put him there to care for it.

To Allah ya ɗauki laka, ya siffanta mutum, sai ya hura masa rai. Sunan mutumen Adamu. Allah ya kafa gona inda Adamu zai zauna, sai ya sa ya kula da ita. 


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-11.jpg?direct&}}


In the middle of the garden, God planted two special trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would die. 

A tsakiyar gonar, Allah ya shubka irin itace biyu: icce na rai da icce sanin nagarta da mugunta. Allah ya cewa Adamu yana iya cin 'ya'yan kowane icce cikin gona amma banda 'ya'ya na iccen sanin nagarta da mugunta. Idan ya kuwa ci shi zai mutu.

Then God said, "It is not good for man to be alone." But none of the animals could be Adam's helper.

Sai Allah ya ce: "Bai kyautu ba mutun ya kasance shi kaɗai".  Amma ba dabbobin da suke iya zama mataimakan Adamu.

So God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.

Sai Allah ya sa Adamu barci mai yauni. Sai Allah ya ɗauki daga haƙarƙarinsa ya halitta mace, ya kuwa kawo mashi ita.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-14.jpg?direct&}}


When Adam saw her, he said, "At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man." This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.

God made man and woman in his own image. He blessed them and told them, "Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!" And God saw that everything he had made was very good, and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of creation.


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-16.jpg?direct&}}


When the seventh day came, God had finished his work. So God rested from all he had been doing. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on this day he rested from his work. This is how God created the universe and everything in it.
