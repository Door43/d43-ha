One day, Peter and John were going to the Temple. As they approached the Temple gate, they saw a crippled man who was begging for money.

Wata rana, Bitrus da Yahaya suka tafi Haikali. Da suka kusato ƙofar Haikalin, sai suka ga wani gurgu yana barar kuɗi.

Peter looked at the lame man and said, "I do not have any money to give you. But I will give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus, get up and walk!"

Bitrus ya dubi gurɓatacen mutumen ya ce:" Ba ni da kuɗin da zan baka. Amma zan baka abin da na ke da. A cikin sunan Yesu, tashi kuma ka yi tafiya!"

Immediately, God healed the lame man, and he began to walk and jump around, and to praise God. The people in the courtyard of the Temple were amazed.

Nan da nan Allah ya warkas da gurɓatacen mutumen, kuma ya fara tafiya, yana tsalle ko'ina, ya kuwa yabi Allah. Mutanen cikin filin Haikalin suka yi mamaki.

A crowd of people quickly came to see the man who was healed. Peter said to them, "Why are you amazed that this man is healed? We did not heal him through our own power or goodness. Rather, it is the power of Jesus and the faith that Jesus gives that healed this man."

Taron jama'a suka zo da sauri su ga mutumen da ya warke. Bitrus ya ce masu:" Me ya sa ku ka yi mamaki da wannan mutum ya warke? Ba mu warkas da shi ba ta wurin ikon kanmu ko kirkin mu. Amma, ikon Yesu da bangaskiyar da Yesu ya bayas ta warkas da mutumen".

"You are the ones who told the Roman governor to kill Jesus. You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. Although you did not understand what you were doing, God used your actions to fulfill the prophecies that the Messiah would suffer and die. So now, repent and turn to God so that your sins will be washed away."

" Kaine wanda ya faɗawa gomnatin Roma ya kashe Yesu. Ka kashe mafarin rai, amma Allah ya tashe shi daga mattatu. Ko da yake ba ka gane abin da ka ke cikin yi ba, Allah ya yi anfani da ayukanka ya cika annabci da ya ce Almasihu zai sha wuya, kuma ya mutu. Yanzu, tuba kuma ka juya ga Allah domin a wanke zunubainka.

The leaders of the Temple were very upset by what Peter and John were saying. So they arrested them and put them into prison. But many of the people believed Peter's message, and the number of men who believed in Jesus grew to about 5,000.

Shugabannin Haikalin suka damu ƙware da abin da Bitrus da Yahaya suke cewa. Sai suka kama su, suka jefa su cikin kurkuku. Amma da yawa daga mutanen suka gaskanta da saƙon Bitrus, kuma yawan mutane da suka bada gaskiya ga Yesu ya ƙaru har ya kai kusan 5,000.

The next day, the Jewish leaders brought Peter and John to the high priest and the other religious leaders. They asked Peter and John, "By what power did you heal this crippled man?"

Ranar gobe, shugabannin Yahudawa suka kai Bitrus da Yahaya wurin babban firist da sauran shugabannin addinai. Suka tambayi Bitrus da Yahaya:" Da wane iko ku ka warkar da gurɓatacen mutumen?"

Peter answered them, "This man stands before you healed by the power of Jesus the Messiah. You crucified Jesus, but God raised him to life again! You rejected him, but there is no other way to be saved except through the power of Jesus!"

Bitrus ya amsa masu:" Wannan mutum ya tsaya kafin ku warkas ta wurin ikon Yesu Almasihu. Kun giciye Yesu, amma Allah ya tashe shi zuwa rai kuma! Kun yashe shi, amma babu wata hanya ta samun ceto in ba ta wurin ikon Yesu ba!"

The leaders were shocked that Peter and John spoke so boldly because they could see that these men were ordinary men who were uneducated. But then they remembered that these men had been with Jesus. After they threatened Peter and John, they let them go.
