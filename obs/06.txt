When Abraham was very old, his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man. So Abraham sent one of his servants back to the land where his relatives lived to bring back a wife for his son, Isaac.

Da Ibrahim ya tsufa sosai, ɗanshi Ishaƙu ya zama namiji. Sai Ibrahim ya aiki ɗaya daga cikin barorinsa can ƙasar iyayensa domin ya komo da mata don ɗansa Ishaƙu.

After a very long journey to the land where Abraham's relatives lived, God led the servant to Rebekah. She was the granddaughter of Abraham's brother.

Bayan tafiya mai nisa zuwa ƙasar kakannin Ibrahim, Allah ya bida baran zuwa ga Rifkatu. Ita jikanyar ɗan uwan Ibrahim ce.

Rebekah agreed to leave her family and go back with the servant to Isaac's home. Isaac married her as soon as she arrived.

Rifkatu ta yarda ta bar iyalinta ta tafi da baran gidan Ishaƙu. Ishaƙu ya aure ta daga zuwnata.

After a long time, Abraham died and all of the promises that God had made to him in the covenant were passed on to Isaac. God had promised that Abraham would have countless descendants, but Isaac's wife, Rebekah, could not have children.

Bayan tsowon kwanaki, Ibrahim ya mutu sai duk alkawarai da Allah yayi masa suka koma kan Ishaƙu. Allah ya alkawarta da Ibrahim zai samu babbar zuriya, amma matar Ishaƙu, Rifkatu ba ta iya haifuwa.

Isaac prayed for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant with twins. The two babies struggled with each other while they were still in Rebekah's womb, so Rebekah asked God what was happening.

Ishaƙu yayi addu'a domin Rifkatu, sai Allah ya yardar mata ta ɗauki cikin tagwaye. Jarirai biyu suna jayyeya tun cikin cikin Rifkatu. Sai Rifkatu ta tambayi Ubangiji me ke faruwa.

God told Rebekah, "Two nations will come from the two sons inside of you. They will struggle with each other and the older son will serve the younger one."

Allah ya cewa Rifkatu:" Al'umma biyu za su fito daga cikinki. Za su yi jayyeya tsakaninsu, kuma babban zai bauta ma ƙaramin."

When Rebekah's babies were born, the older son came out red and hairy, and they named him Esau. Then the younger son came out holding on to Esau's heel, and they named him Jacob.

//A Bible story from: Genesis 24:1-25:26//

//Da Rifkatu ta haifi  ɗiyan, babban ya zo da gashi ja-ja, sai suka kira sunanshi Isuwa.Ƙaramin ya fito yana riƙe da diddigen Isuwa, sai suka kira sunansa Yakubu.//

//Labarin LMT daga Farawa 24:1-25:26 //
