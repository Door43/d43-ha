Jesus sent his apostles to preach and to teach people in many different villages. When they returned to where Jesus was, they told him what they had done. Then Jesus invited them to go with him to a quiet place across the lake to rest for a while. So, they got into a boat and went to the other side of the lake.

Yesu ya aike da manzaninsa da su yi bishara, kuma su koyas da mutane dayawa a ƙauyuka dabam-dabam. Da suka koma inda Yesu yake, suka faɗa mashi abin da suka yi. Sai Yesu ya gayace su su je tare da shi wani wuri mai kwanciyar hankali kusa da kogi, su huta ɗan lokaci. Sai suka shiga cikin jirgin ruwa, kuma suka ratsa wancan shashen kogin.

But there were many people who saw Jesus and the disciples leave in the boat. These people ran along the shore of the lake to get to the other side ahead of them. So when Jesus and the disciples arrived, a large group of people was already there, waiting for them.

Amma akwai mutane da dama da suka ga Yesu da almajiransa sa'adda suka bar jirgin. Waɗannan mutanen suka gudu ta bakin ruwan su je wancan gefen a gabansu. Sai sa'adda Yesu da almajiran suka iso, taron mutane da yawa suna shirye, suna jiransu a can.

The crowd had over 5,000 men in it, not counting the women and children. Jesus felt great compassion towards the people. To Jesus, these people were like sheep without a shepherd. So he taught them and healed the people among them who were sick.

Taron mutanen ya fi mutun 5,000, banda mata da yara. Yesu ya ji juyayin mutanen. Ga Yesu, wannan mutanen suna kama da tumaki marasa makiyayi. Sai ya koyas da su, kuma ya warkas da marasa lafiya da suke cikinsu.

Late in the day, the disciples told Jesus, "It is late and there are no towns nearby. Send the people away so they can go get something to eat."

Da daɗewa cikin rana, almajiran suka faɗa wa Yesu cewa:" Dare ya yi, kuma babu garuruwa a kusa. Aika mutane su je su nemi abinci".

But Jesus said to the disciples, "You give them something to eat!" They responded, "How can we do that? We only have five loaves of bread and two small fish."

Amma Yesu ya ,faɗawa almajiran:" Ku, ku basu wani abu su ci!" Suka amsa masa:" Ƙaƙa za mu iya wannan? Brodi biyar da ƙananan kifi biyu kaɗai garemu".

Jesus told his disciples to tell the people in the crowd to sit down on the grass, in groups of fifty people each.

Yesu ya faɗawa almajiran da su cewa matanen su zauna a kan ciyawa a ƙasa cikin gungun mutane hamsin-hamsin.

Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and thanked God for the food.

Sai Yesu ya ɗauki brodin biyar da kifin biyu, ya ɗaga kai sama, kuma ya godewa Allah domin abincin.

Then Jesus broke the bread and the fish into pieces. He gave the pieces to his disciples to give to the people. The disciples kept passing out the food, and it never ran out! All the people ate and were satisfied.

Sai Yesu ya karya brodin da kifin cikin guntaye. Ya ba almajiran gutsuren su rabawa mutane. Almajiran suka yi ta miƙa abincin, kuma bai ƙare ba! Dukan mutane suka ci, kuma suka ƙoshi.

After that, the disciples collected the food that had not been eaten and it was enough to fill twelve baskets! All the food came from the five loaves of bread and two fish.

//Bayan wannan, almajiran suka tattare abincin da ba a ci ba, kuma ya isa ya cika kwando goma sha biyu! Dukan abincin ya fito daga brodi biyar da kuma kifi biyu.//
