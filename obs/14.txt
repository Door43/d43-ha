After God had told the Israelites the laws he wanted them to obey as part of his covenant with them, they left Mount Sinai. God began leading them from toward the Promised Land, which was also called Canaan. The pillar of cloud went ahead of them towards Canaan and they followed it.

Bayan da Allah ya faɗa ma Isra'ilawa dokokin da yake so su yi biyyaya da su kamar alkawalin sa, sun tafi daga dutsen Sinai. Allah ya ci gaba da bida su zuwa ƙasar alkawali wanda ake kira ƙasar Kan'ana. Al'amudin girgije ya shiga gaban su zuwa Kan'ana, sai suka bishi.

God had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give the Promised Land to their descendants, but now there were many people groups living there. They were called Canaanites. The Canaanites did not worship or obey God. They worshiped false gods and did many evil things.

Allah ya yi wa Ibrahim, Ishaƙu da Yakubu alkawalin zai basu ƙasar alkawali da su da zuriyarsu, amma yanzu akwai mutane da yawa a ƙasar. Ana kiransu Kan'aniyawa. Kan'aniyawa ba su san Allah ba; Suna bauta wa waɗansu alloli daban, kuma sun cika da aikata zunubi.

God told the Israelites, "You must get rid of all the Canaanites in the Promised Land. Do not make peace with them and do not marry them. You must completely destroy all of their idols. If you do not obey me, you will worship their idols instead of me."

Allah ya faɗawa Isra'ilawa:" Sai kun kori Kan'aniyawa daga ƙasar alkawali. Kadda ku yi cuɗanya da su, kadda ku aure su. Ku hallaka dukan gumakansu. Idan ba ku yi mini biyyaya ba, za ku bauta ma gumakansu maimakona.

When the Israelites reached the border of Canaan, Moses chose twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel. He gave the men instructions to go and spy on the land to see what it was like. They were also to spy on the Canaanites to see if they were strong or wear.

Sa'ada Isra'ilawa suka kai iyakar Kan'ana, Musa ya zaɓi mutum goma sha biyu, ɗaya daga cikin kowace kabilar Isra'ila. Ya basu umurnin su je su yi leƙen asirin ƙasar su ga yaya take. Su kuma yi leƙen asirin kan'aniyawa su gani ko masu karfi ne ko kassassu ne.

The twelve men traveled through Canaan for forty days and then they came back. They told the people, "The land is very fertile and the crops are plentiful!" But ten of the spies said, "The cities are very strong and the people are giants! If we attack them, they will certainly defeat us and kill us!"

Mutanen goma sha biyu suka yi tafiya cikin Kan'ana kwana goma, sai suka komo. Su ka cewa mutane:" ƙasar tana da ni'ima sosai da kuma afani mai ɗumbin yawa! Amma goma daga cikin ƴan leƙen asirin suka ce:" Garuruwan ƙarfaffa ne, kuma mutanen manyane! Idan muka faɗasu za su ci mu da yaƙi hakika!"

Immediately Caleb and Joshua, the other two spies, said, "It is true that the people of Canaan are tall and strong, but we can certainly defeat them! God will fight for us!"

Nan da nan Kaleb da Joshuwa, da sauran ƴan leƙen asirin suka ce:" Da gaske ne mutanen Kan'ana masu tsawo ne, kuma suna da ƙarfi, amma muna iya cin su da yaƙi! Allah zai yi kokowa dominmu!"

But the people did not listen to Caleb and Joshua. They became angry with Moses and Aaron and said, "Why did you bring us to this horrible place? We should have stayed in Egypt rather than be killed in battle and our wives and children made slaves." The people wanted to choose a different leader to take them back to Egypt.

Amma matanen basu ji abin da Kaleb da Joshuwa suka faɗa ba. Sun yi fushi da Musa da Haruna, suka ce:" Me ya sa kuka kawo mu cikin wannan matsanancin wuri?Daman mun yi zamanmu a Masar, da a kashemu a yaƙi, matanmu da yaranmu su zama bayi." Mutanen sun so su zaɓi wani jagora ya mayas da su Masar.

God was very angry and came to the Tent of Meeting. God said, "Because you have rebelled against me, all of the people will have to wander in the wilderness. Except for Joshua and Caleb, everyone who is twenty years or older will die there and never enter the Promised Land."

Allah ya husata sosai, sai ya sauko cikin alfarwa ta taruwa, ya ce:" Domin kun yi mini tawaye, dukan mutanen za su yi yawo cikin jeji banda Joshuwa da Kaleb, duk wanda yake da shekara ashirin ko hiye zai mutu, ba zia shiga ƙasar alkawali ba.

When the people heard this, they were sorry they had sinned. They took their weapons and went to attack the people of Canaan. Moses warned them not to go because God was not with them, but they did not listen to him.

Da mutanen suka ji haka, sai suka ƙommace ba su yi zunubi ba. Sai suka ɗauki makamensu, suka je suka faɗa Kan'aniyawa da yaƙi. Musa ya faɗake su kadda su je domin Allah ba ya tare da su, amma ba su kasa kunne gare shi ba.

God did not go with them into this battle, so they were defeated and many of them were killed. Then the Israelites turned back from Canaan and wandered through the wilderness for forty years.

Allah bai tafi tare da su ba cikin yaƙi ba, sai aka ci su da yaƙi, dayawa suka mutu. Sai Isra'ilawa suka juwa baya daga Kan'ana, suka yi yawo cikin jeji har shekara arba'in.

During the forty years that the people of Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided for them. He gave them bread from heaven, called "manna." He also sent flocks of quail (which are medium-sized birds) into their camp so they could have meat to eat. During all that time, God kept their clothes and sandals from wearing out.

Cikin waɗannan shekaru arba'in da mutanen Isra'ila suka yi yawo cikin jeji, Allah ya tanada komi dominsu. Ya basu gurasa daga sama, da ake kira "manna", Ya kuma aiko da maƙware ( kamar tsuntsaye madaidaita) cikin wurin zangunansu don su samu abinci. Cikin dukan wannan lokacin Allah ya tsare kayan jikinsu da takalmansu daga ɓaci.

God even miraculously gave them water from a rock. But despite all this, the people of Israel complained and grumbled against God and against Moses. Even so, God was still faithful to his promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Allah yayi al'ajabin huddo masu ruwan sha daga dutse. Amma duk da wannan, mutanen Isra'ila sun yi ta gunaguni a gaban Allah, da gaban Musa. Duk da hakanan Allah ya riƙe alkawalin da yi wa Ibrahim, Ishaƙu da Yakubu.

Another time when the people did not have any water, God told Moses, "Speak to the rock, and water will come out of it." But Moses dishonored God in front of all the people by hitting the rock twice with a stick instead of speaking to it. Water came out of the rock for everyone to drink, but God was angry with Moses and said, "You will not enter the Promised Land."

Wani lokaci, sa'adda mutane ba su da ruwan sha, Allah ya cewa Musa:" Yi magana ga dutsen, sai ruwa ya fito". Amma Musa ya ƙasƙantar da Allah a gaban mutane da ya bugi dutsen sau biyu maimakon yayi masa magana kawai.

Ruwa ya fito daga dutsen domin kowa ya sha, amma Allah ya yi fushi da Musa har ya ce:" Ba za ka shiga ƙasar alkawali ba".

After the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for forty years, all of them who had rebelled against God were dead. Then God led the people to the edge of the Promised Land again. Moses was now very old, so God chose Joshua to help him lead the people. God also promised Moses that one day, he would send another prophet like Moses.

Bayan da Isra'ilawa suka yi yawo cikin jeji shekara arba'in, duk waɗanda suka yi wa Allah tawaye suka mutu. Sai Allah ya bida mutanen kusan ƙasar alkawalin kuma. Musa fa ya tsufa, sai Allah ya zaɓi Joshuwa ya taimake shi yin jagorar mutanen. Allah yayi wa Musa alkawali zai aiko wani annabi kamar Musa.

Then God told Moses to go to the top of a mountain so he could see the Promised Land. Moses saw the Promised Land but God did not permit him to enter it. Then Moses died, and the Israelites mourned for thirty days. Joshua became their new leader. Joshua was a good leader because he trusted and obeyed God.

//Sai Allah ya cewa Musa jeka bisan ƙolin dutsen domin ka ga ƙasar alkawalin. Musa ya ga ƙasar amma Allah bai yardar mashi ya shiga ba. Sai Musa ya mutu, kuma Isra'ilawa suka makoki kwana arba'in.
