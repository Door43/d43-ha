One of the leaders in the early Church was a man named Stephen. He had a good reputation and was full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom. Stephen did many miracles and reasoned persuasively that people should believe in Jesus.

Ɗaya daga cikin shugabannin Ekkliziar farko, wani mutum ne da ake kira Istifanas. Yana da halin kirki, kuma yana cike da Ruhu Mai Tsarki. Istifanas ya yi al'ajabai da yawa, kuma ya yi shelar gaskiya da mutane ya kamata su gaskanta da Yesu.

One day, when Stephen was teaching about Jesus, some Jews who did not believe in Jesus began to argue with Stephen. They became very angry and lied about Stephen to the religious leaders. They said, "We heard him speak evil things about Moses and God!" So the religious leaders arrested Stephen and brought him to the high priest and the other leaders of the Jews, where more false witnesses lied about Stephen.

Wata rana, sa'adda Istifanas yake koyaswa a kan Yesu, wasu Yahudawa da ba su yarda ba da Yesu suka fara jayyaya da Istifanas. Sai suka husata ƙware, kuma suka yi ƙarya a kan Istifanas ga shugabannai addinai. Suka ce:" Mun ji shi yana saɓo akan Allah da Musa!" Sai shugabannin addinai suka kama Istifanas, suka kai shi wurin babban firist da sauran shugabannin Yahudawa, inda shaidun ƙarya da yawa suka yi ƙarya a kan Istifanas.

The high priest asked Stephen, "Are these things true?" Stephen replied by reminding them of many of the great things God had done from the time of Abraham to the time of Jesus, and how God's people continually disobeyed him. Then he said, "You stubborn and rebellious people always reject the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors always rejected God and killed his prophets. But you did something worse than they did! You killed the Messiah!"

Babban firist ya tambayi Istifanas:" Waɗannan abubuwan gaskiya ne?" Istifanas ya amsa masu ta tuna masu da manyan abubuwan da Allah ya yi tun daga lokacin Ibrahim har zuwa lokacin Yesu, kuma ƙaƙa mutanen Allah suka ta yi masa rashin biyyaya. Sai ya ce:" Ku taurarrun mutane ƴan tawaye kun yas da Ruhu Mai Tsarki koyaushe, kamar yadda kakannunku koyaushe suka yas da Allah, kuma suka kashe annabawansa. Amma kun yi mugunta fiye da hakanan! Kun kashe Almasihu!"

When the religious leaders heard this, they were so angry that they covered their ears and yelled loudly. They dragged Stephen out of the city and threw stones at him in order to kill him.

Da shugabannin addini suka ji haka, sun husata sosai har suka rufe kunnuwansu, kuma suka yi ƙara da ƙarfi. Suka kai Istifanas bayan gari, kuma suka jefa masa duwatsu don su kashe shi.

As Stephen was dying, he cried out, "Jesus, receive my spirit." Then he fell to his knees and cried out again, "Master, do not count this sin against them." Then he died.

Da Istifanas yake mutuwa, yayi ƙara ya ce:" Yesu karɓi ruhuna". Sai ya faɗi a gwiwawunsa yayi ƙara kuma:" Malam, kadda ka ɗaura masu wannan laifi". Sai ya mutu.

A young man named Saul agreed with the people who killed Stephen and guarded their robes while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in Jerusalem started persecuting the followers of Jesus, so the believers fled to other places. But in spite of this, they preached about Jesus everywhere they went.

Wani saurayi mai sunan Shawulu ya yarda da mutanen da suka kashe Istifanas, kuma suka riƙe rigunansu yayin da suke jifansa da duwatsu. Wannan rana, mutane da dama a Urshalima suka fara tsanantawa masu bin Yesu. Sai masu bin suka ƙaura zuwa wasu wurare. Amma duk da wannan suka ci gaba da bisharar Yesu ko'ina suka je.

A disciple of Jesus' named Philip was one of the believers who fled from Jerusalem during the persecution. He went to Samaria where he preached about Jesus and many people were saved. Then one day, an angel from God told Philip to go to a certain road in the desert. As he walked along the road, Philip saw an important official from Ethiopia riding in his chariot. The Holy Spirit told Philip to go and talk to this man.

Wani almajirin Yesu mai sunan Filibus yana ɗaya daga cikin masu bi da suka tsere daga Urshalima lokacin tsanani. Ya tafi Samariya inda ya yi bisharar Yesu, kuma mutane da yawa suka tsira. Sai wata rana, wani mala'ikan Allah ya cewa Filibus ya je kan wata hanya cikin hamada. Da yake tafiya kan hanya, Filibus ya ga wani babban ma'aikacin hukuma na Habasha yana tafiya cikin keken dokinsa. Ruhu Mai Tsarki ya cewa Filibus ya je ya yi magana da mutumen.

When Philip approached the chariot, he heard the Ethiopian reading from what the prophet Isaiah wrote. The man read, "They led him like a lamb to be killed, and as a lamb is silent, he did not say a word. They treated him unfairly and did not respect him. They took his life away from him."

Da Filibus ya kusato keken dokin, Ya ji ba habashen yana karatu daga abin da annabi Ishaya ya rubuta. Mutumen ya karanta:" Suka kai shi kamar ɗan rago a kashe shi, kuma ɗan rago ya yi shuru, bai ce komi ba. Suka wulaƙanta shi, kuma ba su darajanta shi ba. Suka ɗauke masa ransa".

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-45-09.jpg?direct&}}

Philip asked the Ethiopian, "Do you understand what you are reading?" The Ethiopian replied, "No. I cannot understand it unless someone explains it to me. Please come and sit next to me. Was Isaiah writing about himself or someone else?"

Filibus ya tambayi bahabashen:" Ko kana gane abin da kake karantawa? Bahabashen ya amsa:" A'a. Ban iya in gane ba in ba wani ya bayyana mini. In ka yarda zo ka zauna kusana. Ishaya yana rubutu a kanshi ne ko a kan wani ne?"

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-45-10.jpg?direct&}}

Philip explained to the Ethiopian man that Isaiah was writing about Jesus. Philip also used other scriptures to tell him the good news about Jesus.

Filibus ya bayyana wa bahabashen Ishaya yana rubutu a kan Yesu. Filibus kuma ya yi anfani da sauran littatafai ya faɗa masu bisharar Yesu.

As Philip and the Ethiopian traveled, they came to some water. The Ethiopian said, "Look! There is some water! May I be baptized?" And he told the driver to stop the chariot.

Da Filibus da bahabashen suka yi tafiya, sai suka iso wurin wani ruwa. Bahabashen ya ce:" Duba! Akwai wani ɗan ruwa! Ana iya mini baftisma?" Sai ya cewa mai tuƙin ya tsaida keken dokin.

So they went down into the water, and Philip baptized the Ethiopian. After they came up out of the water, the Holy Spirit suddenly carried Philip away to another place where he continued telling people about Jesus.

Sai suka sauka cikin ruwan, kuma Filibus ya yi wa bahabashen baftisma. Da suka fito daga cikin ruwan, Ruhu Mai Tsarki, nan da nan ya kai Filibus wani wuri inda ya ci gaba da faɗawa mutane labarin Yesu.

The Ethiopian continued traveling toward his home, happy that he knew Jesus.

//Bahabashen ya yi tafiyarsa zuwa gidansa, yana murna da ya san Yesu.//
