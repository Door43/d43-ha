God warned Pharaoh that if he did not let the Israelites go, then he would kill all the firstborn males of both people and animals. When Pharaoh heard this he still refused to believe and obey God.

Allah ya faɗakar da Fir'auna da in ya ci gaba da ƙin yarda isra'ilwa su tafi, to zai kashe dukan ƴaƴan fari na mutanen Masar da na dabbobi. Da Fir'auna ya ji hakanan ya ƙi ya gaskanta ko ya yi biyyaya ga Allah.

God provided a way to save the firstborn son of anyone who believed in him. Each family had to choose a perfect lamb and kill it.

Allah ya tanada hanya ceton ƴaƴan farin na duk waɗanda suka gaskanta da shi. Kowane iyali za ya zaɓi ɗan rago maras aibi ya kashe shi.

God told the Israelites to put some of the lamb's blood around the door of their house, and to roast the meat and eat it quickly, along with bread that was made without yeast. He also told them to be ready to leave Egypt when they ate.

Allah ya faɗa wa isra'ilawa su shafa jinin ɗan ragon a jikin kofar gidansu, su kuma gasa naman su cinye shi da sauri, tare da gurasa maras yisti.Ya kuma faɗa masu su fita daga Masar bayan sun ƙare ci.

The Israelites did everything just as God had commanded them to do. In the middle of the night, God went throughout Egypt killing every firstborn son.

Isra'ilawa sun yi daide yadda Allah ya umurce su. A tsakiyar dare, Allah ya sauko, ya kashe dukan ƴaƴan fari na Masar.

All the houses of the Israelites had blood around the doors, so God passed over those houses. Everybody inside them was safe. They were saved because of the lamb's blood.

Dukan gidajen isra'ilawa a shafe suke da jini kewaye da ƙofarsu, sai Allah ya ƙetare gidajen nasu. Dukan wanda yake ciki ya tsira. An cece su saboda jinin ɗan rago.

But the Egyptians did not believe God or obey his commands. So God did not pass over their houses. God killed every one of the Egyptians' firstborn sons.

Amma masarawa basu gaskanta ko su yi biyyaya ga Allah ba. Sai Allah ya bi bisan gidajensu. Allah ya kashe duka ɗan fari na masarawa.

Every Egyptian firstborn male died, from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail, to the firstborn of Pharaoh. Many people in Egypt were crying and wailing because of their deep sadness.

Dukan ɗan fari namiji na Masar ya mutu, daga ɗan fari na cikin kurkuku, zuwa ɗan farin Fir'auna. Mutane dayawa cikin Masar suka yi ta kuka mai tsannani sabili da baƙin cikinsu.

That same night, Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, "Take the Israelites and leave Egypt immediately!" The Egyptian people also urged the Israelites to leave immediately.

//A Bible story from: Exodus 11:1-12:32//

//A wannan daren, Fir'auna ya kira Musa da Haruna ya ce:" Ɗauki isra'ilawa ku fita daga Masar yanzu-yanzu!"//

//Masarawa kuma suka matsawa isra'ilawa su bar ƙasar nan da nan.//
