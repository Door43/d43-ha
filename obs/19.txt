Throughout the history of the Israelites, God sent them prophets. The prophets heard messages from God and then told the people God's messages.

A cikin dukan tarihin Isra'ilawa, Allah ya aike masu da annabawa. Annabawan sun ji saƙonni daga Allah, sun kuma faɗawa mutane saƙonni na Allah.

Elijah was a prophet when Ahab was king over the kingdom of Israel. Ahab was an evil man who encouraged people to worship a false god named Baal. Elijah said to Ahab, "There will be no rain or dew in the kingdom of Israel until I say so." This made Ahab very angry.

Iliya ne annabi a lokacin da Ahab yake mulki kan Isra'ila. Ahab mugun mutum ne da ya tura mutane su bauta wa gumki mai suna Baal. Iliya ya cewa Ahab:" Ba za ayi ruwa ko raɓa ba a cikin mulkin Isra'ila har na yi magana". Wannan ya husatar da Ahab.

God told Elijah to go to a stream in the wilderness to hide from Ahab who wanted to kill him. Every morning and every evening, birds would bring him bread and meat. Ahab and his army looked for Elijah, but they could not find him. The drought was so severe that the stream eventually dried up.

Allah ya ambaci Iliya ya je kusan wani rafi, ya ɓoye wa Ahab da ya nema ya kashe shi. Kowace safiya da kowane dare, tsuntsaye suke kawo masa gurasa da nama. Ahab da rundunar sojojinsa suka nemi Iliya, amma ba su iya samunsa ba. Farin ya yi tsanani sosai har rafin ruwan ya bushe.

So Elijah went to a neighboring country. A widow and her son in that country had almost run out of food because of the famine. But they took care of Elijah, and God provided for them so that their flour jar and their bottle of oil never became empty. They had food through the whole famine. Elijah stayed there for several years.

Sai Iliya ya tafi wata maƙobciyar ƙasa. Wata mace ta mijinta ya mutu da ɗanta a wannan ƙasar, abincinsu ya kusa ƙarewa saboda fari. Amma sun kula da Iliya, kuma Allah ya tanada dominsu har garin abinci da mai ba su ƙare ba.

After three and a half years, God told Elijah to return to the kingdom of Israel and speak with Ahab because he was going to send rain again. When Ahab saw Elijah he said, "There you are, you troublemaker!" Elijah replied to him, "You are the troublemaker! You have abandoned Yahweh, the true God, and worshiped Baal. Bring all the people of the kingdom of Israel to Mount Carmel."

Bayan shekara uku da rabi, Allah ya cewa Iliya ya koma mulkin Isra'ila, ya yi  magana da Ahab domin zai aiko da ruwan sama kuma. Da Ahab ya sake ganin Iliya, sai ya ce:" Kai ne mafarin wahalarmu!" Iliya ya amsa ya ce:" Kai ne ka janyo matsalar! tunda ka bar Yaweh, Allah na gaskiya, kuma ka bauta wa Ba'al. Kawo dukan mutanen mulkin Isra'ila bisan dutsen Karmel".

All the people of the kingdom of Israel, including the 450 prophets of Baal, came to Mount Carmel. Elijah said to the people, "How long will you keep changing your mind? If Yahweh is God, serve him! If Baal is God, serve him!"

Dukan mutanen mulkin Isra'ila, da annabawan Ba'al 450, suka zo dutsen Karmel. Iliya ya cewa mutanen:" Har yaushe za ku taurare tunaninku? In Yahweh ne Allah, ku bauta masa! In Ba'al ne allah, ku bauta masa!

Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Kill a bull and prepare it as a sacrifice, but do not light the fire. I will do the same. The God who answers with fire is the real God." So the priests of Baal prepared a sacrifice but did not light the fire.

Sai Iliya ya cewa annabawan Ba'al:" ku kashe bijimi, ku shirya shi domin hadaya, amma kadda ku kunna wuta. Zan yi hakkanan. Allahn da ya ansa da wuta shine Allah na gaskiya". Sai firistocin Ba'al suka shirya hadayar amma ba su kunna wutar ba.

Then the prophets of Baal prayed to Baal, "Hear us, Baal!" All day long they prayed and shouted and even cut themselves with knives, but there was no answer.

Sai annabawan Ba'al suka yi addu'a ga Ba'al:" Ka saurare  mu Ba'al! Dukan rana suka yi addu''a, kuma suka yi ƙara har suka yanke jikinsu da wuƙaƙe, amma babu amsa.

At the end of the day, Elijah prepared a sacrifice to God. Then he told the people to pour twelve huge pots of water on top of the sacrifice until the meat, the wood, and even the ground around the altar were completely wet.

A ƙarshen yini, Iliya ya shirya hadaya ga Allah. Sai ya cewa mutane su zuba ruwan tulu goma sha biyu bisan bagadin har yayin da naman, da icen, kuma da ƙasa kewaye da bagadin suka jiƙa sarai.

Then Elijah prayed, "Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant. Answer me so that these people will know that you are the true God."

Sai Iliya ya yi addu'a:" Yahweh, Allah na Ibrahim, da Ishaƙu, da Yakubu, gwada mana yau kai ne Allah na Isra'ila, kuma ni bawanka ne. Ka amsa mani domin mutane su sani kai ne Allah na gaskiya".

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-19-11.jpg?direct&}}

Immediately, fire fell from the sky and burned up the meat, the wood, the rocks, the dirt, and even the water that was around the altar. When the people saw this, they fell on the ground and said, "Yahweh is God! Yahweh is God!"

Nan da nan sai wuta ta sauko daga sama, ta cinye nama, da ice, da duwatsu, da salte, har da ruwan kewaye da bagadin. Da mutane suka ga haka, sai suka rusuna ƙasa suka ce:" Yahweh ne Allah! Yahweh ne Allah!"

Then Elijah said, "Do not let any of the prophets of Baal escape!" So the people captured the prophets of Baal and took them away from there and killed them.

Sai Iliya ya ce:" Kadda ku bar ko ɗaya daga annabawan Ba'al su tsira!" Sai mutanen suka kama annabawan Ba'al, suka kai su wani wuri can suka kashe su.

Then Elijah said to King Ahab, "Return immediately to the city, because the rain is coming." Soon the sky grew black, and a heavy rain began. Yahweh had ended the drought and proved that he is the true God.

Sai Iliya ya cewa sarki Ahab:" koma maza-maza cikin birnin, domin ruwan sama yana zuwa". Nan da nan sai samaniya ta yi baƙi, kuma babban ruwa ya fara. Yahweh ya gama yin fari, kuma ya nuna shi ne Allah na gaskiya.

After the time of Elijah, God chose a man named Elisha to be his prophet. God did many miracles through Elisha. One of the miracles happened to Naaman, an enemy commander, who had a horrible skin disease. He had heard of Elisha so he went and asked Elisha to heal him. Elisha told Naaman to dip himself seven times in the Jordan River.

Bayan lokacin Iliya, Allah ya zaɓi wani mutum mai sunan Elisha ya zama annabinsa. Allah yayi al'ajabai da yawa ta wurin Elisha. Ɗaya daga al'ajabin ya faru ga Na'aman, wani shugaba abokin gaba, da ya ke da kuturta. Ya ji labarin Elisha, sai ya je ya roƙi Elisha ya warkasda shi. Elisha ya faɗawa Na'aman ya yi wanka sau bakwai cikin kogin Urdun.

At first Naaman was angry and would not do it because it seemed foolish. But later he changed his mind and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan River. When he came up the last time, his skin was completely healed! God had healed him.

Da fari Na'aman ya husata, kuma ba ya yi biyyaya ba domin ba kangado. Amma bayan wani lokaci, ya canza tunaninsa, ya je ya tsoma kansa sau bakwai cikin kogin Urdun. Da ya fito daga ruwan a kari na ƙarshe, fatar jikinsa ta warke kwatakwata! Allah ya warkar da shi.

God sent many other prophets. They all told the people to stop worshiping idols and to start showing justice and mercy to others. The prophets warned the people that if they did not stop doing evil and start obeying God, then God would judge them as guilty, and he would punish them.

Allah ya aike da wasu annabawa da yawa.Su duka sun fadawa mutane su bar bautar gumaka, kuma su nuna adalci da tausayi ga sauran. Annabawan sun faɗɗakar da mutane da, in ba su daina mugunta ba, suka yi biyyaya ga Allah, to Allah zai hukunta su kamar masu zunubi.

Most of the time, the people did not obey God. They often mistreated the prophets and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet Jeremiah was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.

Yawancin lokaci, mutanen ba su yi biyyaya ga Allah ba. Sun wahalta annabawa sau da yawa har wasu wokatai sun kashe su. Wata sa'a, sun jeffa annabi Irmiya cikin rijiya bussashiya, kuma suka bar shi ya mutu. Ya kamu cikin laaka cikin rijiyar, amma loton nan sai sarkin ya ji tausayin shi, sai ya umurta a janyo shi waje daga cikin rijiya.

The prophets continued to speak for God even though the people hated them. They warned people that God would destroy them if they did not repent. They also reminded people of the promise that God's Messiah would come.

//A Bible story from: 1 Kings 16-18; 2 Kings 5; Jeremiah 38//

//Annabawa sun ci gaba da magana don Allah, ko da yake mutane sun tsane su. Sun fadakar da mutane cewa Allah zai hallaka su in ba su tuba ba. Suka kuma tuna wa mutane alkawali da Allah ya yi na Al'masihu mai zuwa.//
