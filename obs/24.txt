John, the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth, grew up and became a prophet. He lived in the wilderness, ate wild honey and locusts, and wore clothes made from camel hair.

Yahaya, ɗan Zakariya da Alisabatu, ya girma, kuma ya zama annabi. Ya zauna cikin jeji, ya ci zumar daji da fara, kuma yana sa tufafin fatar raƙumi.

Many people came out to the wilderness to listen to John. He preached to them, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of God is near!"

Mutane dayawa zun zo cikin jeji su saurari Yahaya. Ya yi masu wa'azi cewa:" Ku tuba, gama mulkin Allah ya yi kusa!"

When people heard John's message, many of them repented from their sins, and John baptized them. Many religious leaders also came to be baptized by John, but they did not repent or confess their sins.

Da mutane suka ji saƙon Yahaya, dayawa daga cikinsu suka tuba daga zunubensu, kuma Yahaya ya yi musu baftisima. Shugabani adinai da yawa suka zo Yahaya ya yi musu baftisima, amma ba su tuba ba ko su faɗi laifinsu.

John said to the religious leaders, "You poisonous snakes! Repent and change your behavior. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire." John fulfilled what the prophets said, "See, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."

Yahaya ya cewa shuganin adinai:" Ku macizai masu dafi! Ku tuba ku canza tafiyarku. Duk icen da ba ya bada ƴaƴa, za cire shi, kuma a jefa shi cikin wuta." Yahaya ya cika abin da annabawa suka faɗa:" Duba zan aike da masinja na a gaban ka, zai shirya wuri dominka".

Some Jews asked John if he was the Messiah. John replied, "I am not the Messiah, but there is someone coming after me. He is so great that I am not even worthy to untie his sandals."

Wasu yahudawa suka tambayi Yahaya in shine Almasihu. Yahaya ya amsa ya ce :" Ba ni ba ne Almasihu, amma akwai mai zuwa bayana, shi babba ne da ban isa ba in ɓalle takalminsa".

The next day, Jesus came to be baptized by John. When John saw him, he said, "Look! There is the Lamb of God who will take away the sin of the world."

Ranar gobe, Yesu ya zo Yahaya ya yi masa baftisima. Da Yahaya ya gan shi ya ce:" Duba! Ga Ɗan Rago na Allah mai ɗauke zunubin duniya."

John said to Jesus, "I am not worthy to baptize you. You should baptize me instead." But Jesus said, "You should baptize me, because it is the right thing to do." So John baptized him, even though Jesus had never sinned.

Yahaya ya cewa Yesu:" Ni ba isa ba in yi maka baftisima. Kai na ya kamata ka yi mini baftisma." Amma Yesu ya ce:" Ka yi mini baftisma domin daidai ne abin da ya kamata." Sai Yahaya ya yi masa baftisma, ko da yake Yesu bai taɓa yin zunubi ba.

When Jesus came up out of the water after being baptized, the Spirit of God appeared in the form of a dove and came down and rested on him. At the same time, God's voice spoke from heaven, saying, "You are my Son whom I love, and I am very pleased with you."

Da Yesu ya fito daga ruwan baftisma, Ruhun Allah ya sauko a kan shi cikin kamannin kurciya, ya zauna bisansa. A wannan lokacin, muryar Allah ta yi magana daga sama cewa:" Kai ne ɗana ƙaunatace, Ina kwa jin daɗinka."

God had told John, "The Holy Spirit will come down and rest on someone you baptize. That person is the Son of God." There is only one God. But when John baptized Jesus, he heard God the Father speak, saw God the Son, who is Jesus, and he saw the Holy Spirit.

//A Bible story from: Matthew 3; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:1-23//

//Allah ya faɗa wa Yahaya:" Ruhu Mai Tsarki zai sauko ya zauna a kan wani da za yi wa baftisma. Wannan mutum Ɗan Allah ne." Amma sa'ada Yahaya ya yi wa Yesu baftisma, ya ji Allah Uba ya yi magana, ya ga Allah Ɗa, wato Yesu, kuma ya ga Ruhu Mai Tsarki.//
