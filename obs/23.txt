Mary was engaged to a righteous man named Joseph. When he heard that Mary was pregnant, he knew it was not his baby. He did not want to shame Mary, so he planned to quietly divorce her. Before he could do that, an angel came and spoke to him in a dream.

Maryamu tana tare da wani mutum mai sanin gaskiya, mai suna Yusufu wanda yake tashenta. Da ya sami labari Maryamu tana da ciki, ya sani cewa ba ɗansa ba ne. Ba ya so ya sa Maryamu kunya, sai ya tsara ya rabu da ita a ɓoye. Kafin ya yi hakanan, wani mala'ika ya yi magana da shi a mafalki.

The angel said, "Joseph, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The baby that is in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus (which means, 'Yahweh saves'), because he will save the people from their sins."

Mala'ikan ya ce:" Yusufu, kadda ka ji tsoro ka ɗauiki Maryamu kamar matarka. Ɗan da yake cikinta daga Ruhu Mai Tsarki ne. Za ta haifi ɗa. Raɗa masa suna Yesu ( ma'ana, Yahweh yana ceto), domin zai ceci mutane daga zunubensu.

So Joseph married Mary and took her home as his wife, but he did not sleep with her until she had given birth.

Sai Yusufu ya auri Maryamu, kuma ya tafi da ita gida kamar matarsa, amma ba ya kwana da ita ba har sai da ta haifu.

When the time was near for Mary to give birth, the Roman government told everyone to go for a census to the town where their ancestors had lived. Joseph and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.

Da lokaci ya yi da Maryamu za ta haifu, gomnatin Kaisar ya umurci dukan jama'a su je a rubuta su a garin inda kakaninsu suka zauna. Yusufu da Maryamu sun yi tafiya mai nisa daga inda suke a Nazareth zuwa Baitalami sabili da kakansu Dauda ya fito daga Baitalami.

When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place to stay. The only room they could find was a place where animals stayed. The baby was born there and his mother laid him in a feeding trough, since they did not have a bed for him. They named him Jesus.

Da suka iso Baitalami, babu wurin zama. Ɗakin kaɗai da suke iya samu sai a cikin makiyaya inda dabbobi suke zama. An haifi ɗan a can, kuma uwarsa ta sa shi cikin tsummoki don ba su da gado dominshi. Suka sa mashi suna Yesu.

That night, there were some shepherds in a nearby field guarding their flocks. Suddenly, a shining angel appeared to them, and they were terrified. The angel said, "Do not be afraid, because I have some good news for you. The Messiah, the Master, has been born in Bethlehem!"

Wannan daren akwai makiyaya a gonakin kusa suna gadin gargunansu. Ba zato ba tsammani sai mala'ika mai haske ya bayana garesu, sai suka ji tsoro. Mala'ikan ya ce:" Kadda ku ji tsoro domin ina da labari mai daɗi dominku. Almasihu, Mai iko, an haife shi a Baitalami!"

"Go search for the baby, and you will find him wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding trough." Suddenly, the skies were filled with angels praising God, saying, "Glory to God in heaven and peace on earth to the people he favors!"

"Ku je ku nemi jaririn, za ku same shi a nannaɗe a cikin tsummoki yana kwance a makiyaya." Ba zato ba tsammani sai samai suka cika da mala'iku masu yabon Allah, suna cewa:" Ɗaukaka ga Allah a cikin sama, kuma salama a duniya ga mutanen da ya fi ƙauna!"

The shepherds soon arrived at the place where Jesus was and they found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the angel had told them. They were very excited. Mary was very happy, too. The shepherds returned to the fields where their sheep were, praising God for all they had heard and seen.

Makiyayan sai suka zo nan da nan a wurin da Yesu yake, kuma sai suka ganshi kwance a makiyaya kamar yadda mala'ikan ya faɗa.

Sometime later, wise men from countries far to the east saw an unusual star in the sky. They realized it meant a new king of the Jews had been born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to Bethlehem and found the house where Jesus and his parents were staying.

Bayan ɗan wani lokaci, shehuna daga ƙasashe masu nisa na gabas, suka ga wani sabon tauraro a sama. Sai suka gane da cewa wani sabon sarkin yahudawa ya zo duniya. Sai suka yi tafiya mai nisa don sun ziyarci wannan sarkin. Sun zo Baitalami, kuma sun sami wurin da Yesu da Iyayensa suke zama.

When the wise men saw Jesus with his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They gave Jesus expensive gifts. Then they returned home.

//A Bible story from: Matthew 1; Luke 2//

//Da shuhunan suka ga Yesu tare ta uwarsa, suka rusuna ƙasa, suka yi masa sujada. Sun baiwa Yesu kyautai masu tsada. Sai suka koma gida.//

//Labarin LMT daga Matiyu 1; Luka 2//
