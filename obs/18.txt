After many years, David died, and his son Solomon began to rule over Israel. God spoke to Solomon and asked him what he wanted most. When Solomon asked for wisdom, God was pleased and made him the wisest man in the world. Solomon learned many things and was a very wise judge. God also made him very wealthy.

Bayan shekaru da dama, Dauda ya mutu, kuma ɗansa Sulemanu ya fara mulkin Isra'ila. Allah ya yi magana da Sulemanu, kuma ya tambaye shi me ya fi so. Da Sulemanu ya tambayi hikima, Allah ya yi daɗi, sai ya mayas da shi wanda ya fi hikima cikin dukan duniya. Sulemanu ya koyi abubuwa dayawa, kuma zama alkali mai hikima. Allah ya kuma bashi arziki dayawa.

In Jerusalem, Solomon built the Temple for which his father David had planned and gathered materials. People now worshiped God and offered sacrifices to him at the Temple instead of at the Tent of Meeting. God came and was present in the Temple, and he lived there with his people.

A Urshalima, Sulemanu ya gina Haikalin da ubansa Dauda ya nufa ya yi har da ya tara kayan ginin. Mutane, yanzu suna bautar Allah, kuma suna miƙa hadayu gareshi a Haikalin maimakon cikin alfarwa ta taruwa. Allah ya sauko cikin Haikalin, ya zauna tare da mutanensa.

But Solomon loved women from other countries. He disobeyed God by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came from foreign countries and brought their gods with them and continued to worship them. When Solomon was old, he also worshiped their gods.

Amma Sulemanu ya ƙaunaci mata na wasu ƙasashe. Ya yi wa Allah rashin biyyaya da ya auri mata dayawa, kusan 1,000. Yawancin matan sun fito daga baƙin  ƙasashe, kuma sun zo da allolinsu tare da su, suka ci gaba da bauta masu. Da Sulemanu ya tsufa, shi ma ya bauta masu.

God was angry with Solomon and, as a punishment for Solomon's unfaithfulness, he promised to divide the nation of Israel into two kingdoms after Solomon's death.

Allah ya yi fushi da Sulemanu, kuma domin horon rashin riƙe bangaskiyar shi, sai  ya alkawarta ya raba al'umma Isra'ila cikin mulki biyu bayan mutuwar Sulemanu.

After Solomon died, his son, Rehoboam, became king. Rehoboam was a foolish man. All the people of the nation of Israel came together to confirm him as king. They complained to Rehoboam that Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.

Bayan mutuwar Sulemanu, ɗansa Rehobowam ya zama sarki. Rehobowam ba mutun mai hankali bane. Dukan mutanen al'umma Isra'ila suka zo tare suka naɗa shi sarki. Suka kai ƙara cewa Sulemanu ya ɗaura masu aiki mai nauyi da haraji mai ɗumbun yawa.

Rehoboam foolishly answered them, "You thought my father Solomon made you work hard, but I will make you work harder than he did, and I will punish you more harshly than he did."

Rehobowam ba tunani sai ya amsa masu:" Kuna tunani ubana Sulemanu ya sa ku aiki mai wuya, amma zan sa ki fi wannan aiki, kuma zan hore ku fiye da shi."

Ten of the tribes of the nation of Israel rebelled against Rehoboam. Only two tribes remained faithful to him. These two tribes became the kingdom of Judah.

Goma daga cikin kabilun al'ummar Isra'ila suka tayas wa Rehobowam. Kabila biyu kaɗai suka tsaya da shi. Waɗannan kabilun biyu suka zama mulkin Yahuda

The other ten tribes of the nation of Israel that rebelled against Rehoboam appointed a man named Jeroboam to be their king. They set up their kingdom in the northern part of the land and were called the kingdom of Israel.

Sauran kabilu goma na al'ummar Isra'ila da suka tayas wa Rehobowam, suka ɗauki wani mutum mai suna Yerobowam ya zama sarkinsu. Sai suka kafa mulkinsu a arewacin ƙasar, kuma suka kira mulkinsu Isra'ila.

Jeroboam rebelled against God and caused the people to sin. He built two idols for his people to worship instead of worshiping God at the Temple in the kingdom of Judah.

Yerobowam ya wa Allah tawaye, kuma ya sa mutane zunubi. Ya gina gumaka biyu domin mutanensa su bauta masu maimakon su bauta ma Allah a Haikalin mulkin Yahuda.

The kingdoms of Judah and Israel became enemies and often fought against each other.

Mulkin Yahuda da na Isra'ila suka zama abokan gaba, kuma sukan ya yaƙi tsakaninsu.

In the new kingdom of Israel, all the kings were evil. Many of these kings were killed by other Israelites who wanted to become king in their place.

Cikin sabon mulkin Isra'ila, duka sarakai mugaye ne. Dayawa daga cikinsu sun mutu a hannun sauran Isra'ilawan da suke neman sarauta a kabancinsu.

All of the kings and most of the people of the kingdom of Israel worshiped idols. Their idol worship often included sexual immorality and sometimes even child sacrifice.

Dukan sarakuna da yawancin mutanen mulkin Isra'ila suna bautar gumaka. Bautar gumakan tana ƙumshe da mugunyar jinsi da kuma wata sa'a  hadayar yara.

The kings of Judah were descendants of David. Some of these kings were good men who ruled justly and worshiped God. But most of Judah's kings were evil, corrupt, and they worshiped idols. Some of the kings even sacrificed their children to false gods. Most of the people of Judah also rebelled against God and worshiped other gods.

//A Bible story from: 1 Kings 1-6; 11-12//

//Sarakunan Yahuda zuriyar Dauda ce. Waɗansu daga cikinsu mutane masu kirki, su kuma yi mulki da adalci, sun bauta wa Allah. Amma yawancin sarakunan Yahuda mugaye ne, mazambata ne, kuma suna bautar gumaka. Daga cikinsu wasu har sun miƙa ɗiyansu hadaya ga alloli na banza. Yawancin mutanen Yahuda suma suka tayarwa Allah, kuma suka bauta wa waɗansu alloli.//
