Then Jesus told the disciples to get into the boat and sail to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowd. After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he went up on a mountainside to pray. Jesus was there all alone, and he prayed until late at night.

Sai Yesu ya faɗawa almajiran su shiga cikin jirgin ruwa, kuma su ƙetara zuwa wancan shsshen kogin sa'adda yake watsar da taron. Bayan da Yesu ya salami taron jama'a, ya hau dutse domin addu'a. Yesu shi kaɗai ne can, kuma ya yi addu'a har farin dare.

Meanwhile, the disciples were rowing their boat, but by late in the night they had only reached the middle of the lake. They were rowing with great difficulty because the wind was blowing hard against them.

Lokacinan almajiran suna tuƙa jirgin ruwansu, amma can cikin dare sun kai tsakiyar kogin kaɗai. Suna tuƙi da wahala saboda iska tana busawa da ƙarfi gaba da su.

Then Jesus finished praying and went to the disciples. He walked on top of the water across the lake toward their boat!

Sai Yesu ya ƙare addu'a, kuma ya tafi wurin almajiran. Ya yi tafiya bisan ruwan kogin zuwa jirgin ruwan!

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, "Do not be afraid. It is I!"

Almajiran suka ji tsoro sarai da suka ga Yesu, domin sun yi tsamani suna ga fatalwa ne. Yesu ya sani sun tsorota, sai ya kira su ya ce:" Kadda ku ji tsoro. Ni ne!"

Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water." Jesus told Peter, "Come!"

Sai Bitrus ya cewa Yesu:" Malan, in kaine, umurce ni in zo gare ka bisan ruwa". Yesu ya amsawa Bitrus:" zo!"

So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after walking a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus and began to look at the waves and to feel the strong wind.

Sai Bitrus ya fita daga jirgin ruwa, kuma ya fara tafiya bisan ruwa. Amma bayan ya yi tafiya wuri kaɗan, ya juya idanunsa baya, kuma ya fara kallon igiyoyin ruwa da iska mai ƙarfi.

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink in the water. He cried out, "Master, save me!" Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, "You man of little faith, why did you doubt?"

Sai Bitrus ya razana, kuma ya fara lumewa cikin ruwa. Ya yi kira:" Malan, ka cece ni!" Yesu ya je nan da nan ya kama shi. Sai ya cewa Bitrus:" Kai mutum mai ƙanƙanuwar bangaskiya, me ya sa ka yi shakka?"

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped blowing and the water became calm. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, "Truly, you are the Son of God."

//Da Bitrus da Yesu suka isa cikin jirggin ruwan, iska ya tsaya nan da nan, kuma ruwa ya kwanta. Almajiran suka yi mamaki. Suka yabi Yesu suna cewa:" Gaskiya kai Ɗan Allah ne".//
