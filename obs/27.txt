One day, an expert in the Jewish law came to Jesus to test him, saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus answered, "What is written in God's law?"

Wata rana, wani babban masanin shari'ar Yahudawa ya zo wurin Yesu domin ya gwada shi.Sai ya ce:" Malan, me zan yi in gadi rai na har abada?" Yesu ya amsa:" Me aka rubuta cikin shari'ar Allah?"

The law expert replied that God's law says, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind. And love your neighbor as yourself." Jesus answered, "You are correct! Do this and you will live."

Masanin shari'ar ya amsa masa cewa, shari'ar Allah ta ce:" Ka ƙaunaci Ubangiji Allahnka da dukan zuciyarka, da dukan ranka, da ƙarfinka, kuma da tunaninka. Kuma ka ƙaunaci maƙwabcinka kamar kanka". Yesu ya amsa masa cewa:" Haka ne! Yi haka, kuma za ka rayu".

But the law expert wanted to prove that he was righteous, so he asked, "Who is my neighbor?"

Amma ba farisen yana so ya gwada shi yana daidai, sai ya yi tambaya:" Wanene maƙwabcina?"

Jesus answered the law expert by telling a story. "There was a Jewish man who was traveling along the road from Jerusalem to Jericho."

Yesu ya amsawa ba farisen ta wurin gaya mashi wani labari:" Akwai wani ba yahude da ya tafi balagro daga Urshalima zuwa Yeriko".

"While the man was traveling, he was attacked by a group of robbers. They took everything he had and beat him until he was almost dead. Then they went away."

Lokacin da mutumen yake tafiya, sai ƴan fashi suka faɗa shi. Suka sace dukan abin da yake da, kuma suka duke shi har ya kai bakin mutuwa, Sa'annan suka tsere".

"Soon after that, a Jewish priest happened to walk down that same road. When this religious leader saw the man who had been robbed and beaten, he moved to the other side of the road, ignored the man who needed help, and kept on going. "

Lokaci kaɗan bayan wannan, wani firist ba yahude ya biyo hanyar. Da wannan shugaban addinin ya ga mutumen da aka yi wa sata, kuma aka yi masa duka, ya ya koma wata hanya, ya manta da shi mutumen da yake bukatar taimako, kuma ya yi tafiya tasa".

"Not long after that, a Levite came down the road. (Levites were a tribe of Jews who helped the priests at the Temple.) The Levite also crossed over to the other side of the road and ignored the man who had been robbed and beaten."

" Ba da daɗewa ba, wani balawiye ya zo kan hanyar.( lawiyawa kabila ce ta Yahudawa da suke taimakon firistoci a Haikali). Balawiyen shi ma ya sauya hanya, ya manta da mutumen da aka yi wa sata, kuma aka yi masa duka".

"The next person to walk down that road was a Samaritan. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews who had married people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) But when the Samaritan saw the Jewish man, he felt very strong compassion for him. So he cared for him and bandaged his wounds."

" Mutumen mai zuwa kan hanyar basamariye ne. ( Samariyawa wata zuriyar Yahudawa ne da suka auri mutanen wasu kabila. Samariyawa da Yahudawa ba sa ƙaunar juna). Amma da basamariyen ya ga bayahude a kwance, sai ya yi juyayinshi ƙware. Sai ya lura da shi, kuma ya ɗaure ciyonsa".

"The Samaritan then lifted the man onto his own donkey and took him to a roadside inn where he took care of him."

Basamariyen ya ɗaura mutumen kan jakinshi, kuma ya kai shi wani gida a shashen hanyar, inda ya kula da shi".

"The next day, the Samaritan needed to continue his journey. He gave some money to the person in charge of the inn and said, 'Take care of him, and if you spend any more money than this, I will repay those expenses when I return.'"

" Washe gari, basamariyen yana bukata ya ci gaba da balaguronsa. Ya bada ƴan kuɗi ga mutumen da ke kula da gidan baƙin, kuma ya ce:" Ka kula da shi, kuma in ka kashe kuɗi fiye da haka, zan biya ka in na dawo".

Then Jesus asked the law expert, "What do you think? Which one of the three men was a neighbor to the man who was robbed and beaten?" He replied, "The one who was merciful to him." Jesus told him, "You go and do the same."

//A Bible story from: Luke 10:25-37//

//Sai Yesu ya tambayi ba farisen:" Me kake tunani? wannene daga cikin mutanen uku maƙwabcin mutumen da aka yi wa sata, kuma aka yi wa duka?" Ya amsa masa:" Wanda ya ji tausayinsa". Yesu ya ce masa:" Je ka, ka yi hakanan".//
