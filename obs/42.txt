On the day that Jesus was raised from the dead, two of his disciples were going to a nearby town. As they walked, they talked about what had happened to Jesus. They had hoped that he was the Messiah, but then he was killed. Now the women said he was alive again. They did not know what to believe.

A ranar da Yesu ya tashi daga mattatu, biyu daga almajiransa suna tafiya wani gari a kusa. Sa'adda suke tafiya, sun a zancen abin da ya faru ga Yesu. Sun yi zato cewa da shine Almasihu, amma sai aka kashe shi. Yanzu matan suka ce yana da rai kuma. Ba su san wanda za su gaskanta ba.

Jesus approached them and started walking with them, but they did not recognize him. He asked what they were talking about, and they told him about all the remarkable things that had happened concerning Jesus during the previous few days. They thought they were talking to a visitor who did not know what had happened in Jerusalem.

Yesu ya kusato da su, kuma ya fara tafiya tare da su, amma ba su gane shi ba. Ya yi tambaya zance me suke yi, sai suka faɗa masa dukan abin ban mamaki ba ya faru da Yesu kwanakin da suka wuce. Sun yi tsammani suna magana da wani baƙo da bai san abin da ya faru ba a Urshalima.

Then Jesus explained to them what God's word said about the Messiah. He reminded them that the prophets said the Messiah would suffer and be killed, but would rise again on the third day. When they arrived at the town where the two men planned to stay, it was almost evening.

Sai Yesu ya fasarta masu abin da maganar Allah ta ce a kan Almasihu. Ya tuna masu cewa da annabawa sun riga sun faɗi Almasihu zai sha wahala, kuma za a kashe shi, amma zai kuwa tashi a kwana na uku. Da suka iso garin inda mutanen biyu suka nufa su zauna, dare ya kusa yi.

The two men invited Jesus to stay with them, so he did. When they were ready to eat the evening meal, Jesus picked up a loaf of bread, thanked God for it, and then broke it. Suddenly, they recognized that he was Jesus. But at that moment, he disappeared from their sight.

Mutanen biyu suka gayaci Yesu ya zauna tare da su, sai ya yarda. Sa'adda suka yi shirin ci abincin dare, Yesu ya ɗauki guntun gurasa, ya yi gadiya ga Allah, kuma ya Karya ta. Nan da nan sai suka gane shine Yesu. Amma a wannan lokacin, sai ya bace daga gabansu.

The two men said to each other, "That was Jesus! That is why our hearts were burning when he explained God's word to us!" Immediately, they went back to Jerusalem. When they arrived, they told the disciples, "Jesus is alive! We have seen him!"

Mutanen biyu suka ce a tsakaninsu:" Yesu ne! shi ya sa zukatanmu suka huru lokacin da ya fasarta mana maganar Allah! Nan take sai suka koma Urshalima. Da suka iso, suka fadawa almajiran:" Yesu yana da rai! Mun gane shi!"

As the disciples were talking, Jesus suddenly appeared in the room with them and said, "Peace to you!" The disciples thought he was a ghost, but Jesus said, "Why are you afraid and doubting? Look at my hands and feet. Ghosts do not have bodies like I do." To prove that he was not a ghost, he asked for something to eat. They gave him a piece of cooked fish, and he ate it.

Yayin da almajiran suke hira, Yesu, ba zato ba tsammani, ya bayyana garesu cikin ɗakin ya ce:" Salama a gareku!" Almajiran sun yi tsammani fatalwa ce, amma Yesu ya ce:" Me ya sa ku ke tsoro, kuma kuna shakka? Ku dubi hannuwa na da ƙafafuwa na. Fatalwu ba su da jiki kamar yadda nake da". Domin su tabbata shi ba fatalwa ba ne, sai ya tambaye su abinci. Suka bashi ɗan guntun kifi a dafe, kuma ya ci shi.

Jesus said, "I told you that everything written about me in God's word must be fulfilled." Then he opened their minds so that they could understand God's word. He said, "It was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer, die, and rise from the dead on the third day."

Yesu ya ce:" Na riga na gaya maku cewa da duk abin da aka rubuta a kaina cikin maganar Allah sai ya cika". Sai ya buɗe hankalinsu don su gane maganar Allah. Ya ce:" A rubuce yake da daɗewa cewa Almasihu zai sha wahala, ya mutu, kuma ya tashi daga mattatu a kwana na uku".

"It was also written in the scriptures that my disciples will proclaim that everyone should repent in order to receive forgiveness for their sins. They will do this starting in Jerusalem, and then go to all people groups everywhere. You are witnesses of these things."

" A rubuce yake kuma cikin litafi cewa da almajirai za su shaidawa kowa ya tuba domin ya samu gafarar zunubainsa. Za su yi haka farawa cikin Urshalima, kuma za su je wurin dukan mutane ko'ina. Ku ne shaiduna na dukan waɗannan abubuwan".

During the next forty days, Jesus appeared to his disciples many times. Once, he even appeared to more than 500 people at the same time! He proved to his disciples in many ways that he was alive, and he taught them about the kingdom of God.

Cikin kwanaki arba'in bayan tashinsa, Yesu ya bayyana ga almajiransa sau da yawa. Wata rana ya bayyana ga mutane hiye da 500 gami guda! Ya tabbatarwa almajiransa ta hanyoyi da dama yana da rai, kuma ya koyas da su a kan mulkin Allah.

Jesus said to his disciples, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. So go, make disciples of all people groups by baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and by teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. Remember, I will be with you always."

Yesu ya cewa almajiransa:" An bani dukan iko cikin sama da cikin ƙasa. Sai ku je ku almajirtar da dukan ɗarikun mutane, kuna yi masu baftisma cikin suna Uba, da ɗa, da Ruhu Mai Tsarki, kuma ku koyas da su, su yi biyyaya da duk abin da na umurce ku. Ku tuna ina tare da ku kullum".

Forty days after Jesus rose from the dead, he told his disciples, "Stay in Jerusalem until my Father gives you power when the Holy Spirit comes on you." Then Jesus went up to heaven, and a cloud hid him from their sight. Jesus sat down at the right hand of God to rule over all things.

//Kwana arba'in bayan da Yesu ya tashi daga mattatu, ya fadawa almajiransa:" ku zauna a Urshalima har sa'adda Ubana ya ba ku iko randa Ruhu Mai Tsarki ya zo bisanku". Sai Yesu ya hau sama, kuma gajimare ya ɓoye shi daga idanunsu. Yesu ya zauna a hannun damar Allah don ya yi mulki bisan dukan komi.//
