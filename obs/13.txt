After God led the Israelites through the Red Sea, he led them through the wilderness to a mountain called Sinai. This was the same mountain where Moses had seen the burning bush. The people set up their tents at the base of the mountain.

Bayan da Allah ya bida Isra'ilawa ta cikin Bahar Maliya, ya bida su cikin jeji zuwa dutsen Sinai. A wannan wurin ne Musa ya ga al'amudi mai cin wuta. Mutanen suka yi zango a ƙasan dutsen.

God said to Moses and the people of Israel, "If you will obey me and keep my covenant, you will be my prized possession, a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation."

Allah ya cewa Musa da mutanen Isra'ila:" In kun yi mini biyyaya, kun kuma riƙe alkawarina, za ku zama nawa masu tamani, mulkin firistoci, al'umma mai tsarki.

Three days later, after the people had prepared themselves spiritually, God came down on top of Mount Sinai with thunder, lightning, smoke, and a loud trumpet blast. Only Moses was allowed to go up the mountain.

Bayan kwana uku, bayan da mutane suka shirya kansu cikin ruhaniya, Allah ya sauko bisa dutsen Sinai da tsawa, da walkiya, da hayaƙi, da kakaki may babban ƙara. Musa ƙaɗai ne aka yardar ma ya je saman dutsen.

Then God gave them the covenant and said, "I am Yahweh, your God, who saved you from slavery in Egypt. Do not worship other gods."

Sai Allah ya basu alkawali:" Ni ne Yahweh, Allahnku, da ya cece ku daga bauta a Masar, Kar ku bautawa waɗansu alloli".

"Do not make idols and do not worship them, because I, Yahweh, am a jealous God. Do not use my name in a disrespectful way. Be sure to keep the Sabbath day holy. That is, do all your work in six days, for the seventh day is a day for you to rest and to remember me."

"Kadda ku yi kumaka, kadda ku bauta masu, domin Ni ne Yahweh, Ina da kishi. Kadda ku yi anfani da sunana a banza. Ku kiyaye ranar Asabar da tsarki. Kenan ku yi dukan aikinku a kwana shidda, kwana na bakwai ranar hutu ce da tunawa da Ni.

"Honor your father and your mother. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Do not desire to have your neighbor's wife, his house, or anything that belongs to him."

" Ka girmama mahaifinka da mahaifiyarka. Kadda ka yi kisan kai. Kadda ka yi zina. Kadda ka yi sata. kadda ka yi ƙarya. Kadda ka yi fasiƙanci da matar maƙobcinka ko ka yi ƙyashin gidansa ko kayansa.

Then God wrote these Ten Commandments on two stone tablets and gave them to Moses. God also gave many other laws and rules to follow. If the people obeyed these laws, God promised that he would bless and protect them. If they disobeyed them, God would punish them.

Sai Allah ya rubuta wannan dokoki goma bisan alloli biyu na dutse ya kuma baiwa Musa. Allah ya kuma bada waɗansu dokoki kamar haka. Idan mutane sun yi biyyaya da dokokin, Allah yayi alkawalin sa masu albarka da kuma kare su. Idan sun ƙi biyyaya Allah zai hore su.

God also gave the Israelites a detailed description of a tent he wanted them to make. It was called the Tent of Meeting, and it had two rooms, separated by a large curtain. Only the high priest was allowed to go into the room behind the curtain, because God lived there.

Allah ya kuma ba Isra'ilawa umurni yadda za su gina alfarwa. Ana kiranta alfarwa taruwa, tana da ɗaki biyu a rabe da labule inda Allah zai zauna.

Anyone who disobeyed God's law could bring an animal to the altar in front of the Tent of Meeting as a sacrifice to God. A priest would kill the animal and burn it on the altar. The blood of the animal that was sacrificed covered the person's sin and made that person clean in God's sight. God chose Moses' brother, Aaron, and Aaron's descendants to be his priests.

Duk wanda ya yi rashin biyyaya ga dokokin Allah, sai ya kawo dabba wurin bagadi gaban alfarwa ta taruwa don hadaya. Firist zai yanke dabbar, ya kuma ƙone ta a bisan bagadin. Jinin dabbar da aka miƙa hadaya ya shafe zunubin mutumin a gaban Allah. Allah ya zaɓi ɗan uwan Musa, Haruna da zuriyarsa su zama firistoci.

The people all agreed to obey the laws that God had given them, to worship only God, and to be his special people. But a short time after they promised to obey God, they sinned terribly.

Dukan mutane suka yarda su yi biyyaya da dokokin da Allah ya basu, su bauta ma Allah kaɗai, su zama keɓɓaɓun matanensa. Amma bayan lokaci ƙaɗan da wannan alkawalin, sai suka yi zunubi.

For many days, Moses was on top of Mount Sinai talking with God. The people became tired of waiting for him to return. So they brought gold to Aaron and asked him to make an idol for them!

Kwana dayawa Musa yana kan dutsen Sinai yana magana da Allah. Mutanen sun gaji da jiran shi ya komo, sai suka kawo zinariya wurin Haruna suka tambaye shi ya gina gumki dominsu.

Aaron made a golden idol in the shape of a calf. The people began to wildly worship the idol and make sacrifices to it! God was very angry with them because of their sin and planned to destroy them. But Moses prayed for them, and God listened to his prayer and did not destroy them.

Haruna ya yi gumkin zinariya kamar ɗan maraƙi. Sai mutanen suka fara bauta masa, suna yi masa hadaya! Allah ya husata sai yayi ƙudurin ya hallaka su. Amma Musa ya yi addu'a saboda su, sai Allah ya ji roƙonshi ya fasa hallaka su.

When Moses came down the mountain and saw the idol, he was so angry that he smashed the stones on which God had written the Ten Commandments.

Da Musa ya sauko daga dutsen ya ga gumkin, ya husata sosai, sai ya fashe allolin waɗanda suke da dokoki goma a rubuce.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-13-14.jpg?direct&}}

Then Moses beat the idol into powder, threw the powder into some water and made the people drink the water. God sent a plague on the people and many of them died.

Sai Musa ya kwankatse gumki, ya zama gari, ya watsar da garin cikin ruwa, ya kuma sa mutanen suka sha ruwan. Allah ya aike da alloba bisan mutanen, dayawa suka mutu.

Moses climbed the mountain again and prayed that God would forgive the people. God listened to Moses and forgave them. Moses wrote the Ten Commandments on new stone tablets to replace the ones he had broken. Then God led the Israelites away from Mount Sinai toward the Promised Land.

//A Bible story from: Exodus 19-34//

//Musa ya hau dutsen kuma, yayi addu'a Allah ya gafartawa mutanen. Allah ya amshi addu'ar, ya huma gafarta masu.//

//Musa ya rubuta dokokin goma a kan sabobin allolin dutse kanbacin karyayyun. Sai Allah ya bida Isra'ilawa daga dutsen Sinai zuwa ƙasar alkawali.//

//Labarin LMT daga Fitowa 19-34//
