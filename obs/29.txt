One day, Peter asked Jesus, "Master, how many times should I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?" Jesus said, "Not seven times, but seventy times seven!" By this, Jesus meant that we should always forgive. Then Jesus told this story.

Wata rana, Bitrus ya tambayi Yesu:" Malan, sau nawa zan gafartawa ɗan uwana in ya yi mani zunubi? Sau bakwai?" Yesu ya ce :" Ba sau bakwai ba, amma saba'in sau bakwai!" Da wannan, Yesu yana nufin kenan kullum mu gafarta. Sai Yesu ya faɗi wani labarin.

Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. One of his servants owed a huge debt worth 200,000 years' wages."

Yesu ya ce:" Mulkin Allah yana kama da wani sarki da ya ajiye kuɗi a wurin barorinsa. Ɗata daga cikin barorin nasa yana da  bashi mai nauyin albashin shekara 200,000".

"Since the servant could not pay the debt, the king said, 'Sell this man and his family as slaves to make payment on his debt.'"

" Domin baran ba ya iya biyan bashin, sai sarkin ya ce:" Saida wannan mutumen da iyalinsa maimakon bayi don biyan bashin".

"The servant fell on his knees before the king and said, 'Please be patient with me, and I will pay the full amount that I owe you.' The king felt pity for the servant, so he canceled all of his debt and let him go."

" Baran ya faɗi a kan gwiwawunsa gaban sarki, kuma ya ce:" Yi haƙuri da ni in ka yarda, kuma zan biya dukan kuɗin da ka ke bina". Sarkin ya ji tausayin baran, sai ya shafe dukan bashin, kuma ya bar shi ya tafi".

"But when the servant went out from the king, he found a fellow servant who owed him a debt worth four months' wages. The servant grabbed his fellow servant and said, 'Pay me the money that you owe me!'"

" Amma da baran ya fita daga wurin sarkin, sai ya iske wani ɗan taliki da yake bi bashin tsowon wata huɗu na albashi. Sai baran ya kama ɗan talikin ya ce:" Biya dukan bashin da nake binka!"

"The fellow servant fell on his knees and said, 'Please be patient with me, and I will pay the full amount that I owe you.' But instead, the servant threw his fellow servant into prison until he could pay the debt."

Ɗan talikin ya faɗi a gwiwowinsa ya ce:" In ka yarda ka yafe mini, kuma zan biya dukan kuɗin da ka biyo ni". Amma da ya yi hakanan, baran, sai ya jefa ɗan talikin cikin kurkuku har sai da ya iya biyan bashin.

"Some other servants saw what had happened and were greatly disturbed. They went to the king and told him everything."

" Waɗansu barori da suka ga abin da ya faru, suka damu ƙwarai. Suka tafi wajen sarkin, kuma suka faɗa masa komi".

"The king called the servant and said, 'You wicked servant! I forgave your debt because you begged me. You should have done the same.' The king was so angry that he threw the wicked servant into prison until he could pay back all of his debt."

" Sarkin ya kira baran, kuma ya ce:" Kai mugun bawa! Na yafe maka bashinka don ka roƙe ni. Da kaima ka yi hakanan". Sarkin ya husata sosai, sai ya jefa mugun baran cikin kurkuku har sa'adda ya iya biyan bashin.

Then Jesus said, "This is what my heavenly Father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."
