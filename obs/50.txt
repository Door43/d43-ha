For almost 2,000 years, more and more people around the world have been hearing the good news about Jesus the Messiah. The Church has been growing. Jesus promised he would return at the end of the world. Though he has not yet come back, he will keep his promise.

Kusan shekaru 2,000 mutane da yawa cikin duniya suka ji bisaharar Yesu Almasihu. Ekkliziya ta ci gaba da girma. Yesu ya alkawalta zai sake dawowa a ƙarshen duniya. Ko da yake bai komo ba tukuna, zai cika alkawalinsa.

As we wait for Jesus to return, God wants us to live in a way that is holy and that honors him. He also wants us to tell others about his kingdom. When Jesus was living on earth he said, "My disciples will preach the good news about the kingdom of God to people everywhere in the world, and then the end will come."

Lokacin da muke jiran dawowar Yesu, Allah yana so mu yi rayuwa mai tsarki, kuma mai darajanta shi. Yana kuma so mu faɗawa sauran labarin mulkinsa. Yayin da Yesu yake a duniya ya ce:" Almajiraina za su shaida bisharar mulkin Allah ga mutane ko'ina cikin duniya, sa'annan ƙarshe za ya zo".

Many people groups still have not heard about Jesus. Before he returned to heaven, Jesus told Christians to proclaim the good news to people who have never heard it. He said, "Go and make disciples of all people groups!" and, "The fields are ripe for harvest!"

Ƙungiyoyin mutane da dama, har yanzu ba su sami labarin Yesu ba. Kafin ya koma sama, Yesu ya faɗawa Krista su shaida bishara ga mutanen da basu taɓa jin labarin ba. Ya ce:" Ku je ku almajirtadda dukan mutane!" Kuma :" Gonaki sun nuna don girbi!"

Jesus also said, "A servant is not greater than his master. Just as the authorities of this world have hated me, they will torture and kill you because of me. Although in this world you will suffer, be encouraged because I have defeated Satan, the one who rules this world. If you remain faithful to me to the end, then God will save you!"

Yesu kuwa ya ce:" Bawa bai fi malamin shi ba. Kamar yadda hukumar duniya suka ƙini, za su yi muku azaba kuma su kashe ku sabili da ni. Ko da yake za ku sa wuya cikin duniyar nan, ku ƙarfafa gama Na yi nasara da Shaiɗan, wanda yake mulkin wannan duniya. Idan kun jumre har ƙarshe, sai Allah ya cece ku!"

Jesus told his disciples a story to explain what will happen to people when the world ends. He said, "A man planted good seed in his field. While he was sleeping, his enemy came and planted weed seeds along with the wheat, and then he went away."

Yesu ya faɗawa almajiransa wani labari don ya fasarta abin da zai faru da mutane in duniya ta ƙare. Ya ce:" Wani mutum ya shubka iri mai kyau a gonarsa. Sa'adda yake barci, abokin gabansa ya zo, kuma ya shubka irin ciyawa tare da alkama, kuma ya tafi".

"When the plants sprouted, the servants of the man said, 'Master, you planted good seed in that field. So why are there weeds in it?' The master answered, 'An enemy must have planted them.'"

"Da shubkar ta tsiro, bayin mutumen suka ce:" Malan, ka shubka iri mai kyau a wannan gonar. Ta me ya sa akwai ciyawa a cikinta?" Malamin ya amsa:" Abokin gaba ya shubka su".

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-07.jpg?direct&}}

"The servants responded to their master, 'Should we pull out the weeds?' The master said, 'No. If you do that, you will pull out some of the wheat as well. Wait until the harvest and then gather the weeds into piles to be burned, but bring the wheat into my barn.'"

"Bayin suka amsawa malamin su:" Ko za mu cire ciyawa?" Malamin ya ce:"A'a. Idan kun yi haka, za ku cire wasu ƴan alkama kuwa. Ku dakata har lokacin girbi ya yi, sa'annan ku tara ciyawa tari tari don ƙonawa, amma ku kai alkama cikin sito na".

The disciples did not understand the meaning of the story, so they asked Jesus to explain it to them. Jesus said, "The man who planted the good seed represents the Messiah. The field represents the world. The good seed represents the people of God's kingdom."

Almajiran ba su gane manufar labarin ba, sai suka tambayi Yesu ya fasarta masu shi. Yesu ya ce:" Mutumen da ya shubka iri mai kyau wakilin Almasihu ne. Gonar wakilin duniya ne. Irin mai kyau wakilin mutanen mulkin Allah ne".

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-09.jpg?direct&}}

"The weeds represent the people who belong to the evil one. The enemy who planted the weeds represents the devil. The harvest represents the end of the world, and the harvesters represent God's angels."

" Ciyawa wakilin mutanen mugun ne. Abokin gaban da ya shubka ciyawar wakilin Shaiɗan ne. Girbin wakilin ƙarshen duniya ne, kuma masu girbi wakilai mala'ikun Allah ne".

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-10.jpg?direct&}}

"When the world ends, the angels will gather together all the people who belong to the devil and throw them into a raging fire, where they will cry and grind their teeth in terrible suffering. Then the righteous ones will shine like the sun in the kingdom of God their Father."

"A ƙarshen duniya, mala'iku za su tara dukan mutanen da suke na mugu, kuma su jeffa su cikin wutar ƙiburutu, inda za su yi kuka da ciza haƙora cikin muhimmiyar azaba. Sai masu adalci za su haskaka kamar rana cikin mulkin Allah Ubansu".

Jesus also said that he would return to earth just before the world ends. He will come back the same way that he left, that is, he will have a physical body and will come on the clouds in the sky. When Jesus returns, every Christian who has died will rise from the dead and meet him in the sky.

Yesu ya kuwa ƙara da cewa zai dawo duniya daidai kafin ƙarshen zamani. Zai dawo kamar yadda ya tafi, kuma zai sami jikin mutuntaka, kuma zai komo cikin gajimare na sama.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-12.jpg?direct&}}

Then the Christians who are still alive will rise up into the sky and join with the other Christians who rose from the dead. They will all be with Jesus there. After that, Jesus will live with his people in perfect peace and unity forever.

Sa'annan Krista waɗanda suke da rai za su tashi zuwa sama su sadu da sauran Krista da suka tashi daga mattattu. Za su zauna can tare da Yesu. Bayan wannan, Yesu zai zauna tare da mutanensa cikin cikkakkiyar salama da haɗin kai har abada.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-13.jpg?direct&}}

Jesus promised to give a crown to everyone who believes in him. They will live and reign with God in perfect peace forever.

Yesu ya yi alkawali cewa da zai bayar da rawani ga kowane mai gaskantawa da shi. Za su rayu, kuma su yi mulki da Allah cikin cikkakkiyar salama har abada.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-14.jpg?direct&}}

But God will judge everyone who does not believe in Jesus. He will throw them into hell, where they will weep and grind their teeth in anguish forever. A fire that never goes out will continually burn them, and worms will never stop eating them.

Amma Allah zai shar'anta duk wanda ba ya gaskanta da Yesu ba. Zai jeffa su cikin jahannama, inda za su yi kuka da cizon haƙora cikin tsoro har abada. Wutar da ba ta ƙare ci, za ta ƙone su kulluyomi, kuma tsutsotsi ba su fasa cinsu ba.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-50-15.jpg?direct&}}

When Jesus returns, he will completely destroy Satan and his kingdom. He will throw  Satan into hell where he will burn forever, along with everyone who chose to follow him rather than to obey God.

Sa'adda Yesu ya dawo, zai kamala hallakar Shaiɗan da mulkinsa. Zai jeffa Shaiɗan cikin jahannama inda zai ƙone har abada, tare da duk wanda ya zaɓa ya bi shi maimakon ya yi biyyaya da Allah.

Because Adam and Eve disobeyed God and brought sin into this world, God cursed it and decided to destroy it. But some day God will create a new heaven and a new earth that will be perfect.

Sabili da Adamu da Hawa'u sun yi wa Allah rashin biyyaya, kuma sun sanyo zunubi cikin duniya, Allah ya la'anta ta, kuma ya yanke ya hallaka ta. Amma wata rana Allah ya halita sabon sama da sabuwar duniya cikkakkiya.

Jesus and his people will live on the new earth, and he will reign forever over everything that exists. He will wipe away every tear and there will be no more suffering, sadness, crying, evil, pain, or death. Jesus will rule his kingdom with peace and justice, and he will be with his people forever.
