At last it was time for the Israelites to enter Canaan, the Promised Land. Joshua sent two spies to the Canaanite city of Jericho that was protected by strong walls. In that city there lived a prostitute named Rahab who hid the spies and later helped them to escape. She did this because she believed God. They promised to protect Rahab and her family when the Israelites would destroy Jericho.

A ƙarshe sai lokaci yayi da Isra'ilawa za su shiga Kan'ana ƙasar alkawali. Joshuwa ya aiki ƴan leƙen asiri biyu garuruwan kan'aniyawa da suke kewaye da katanga mai ƙarfi.

Sun yi ƙudurin taimakon Rahab da iyalinta lokacin da Isra'ilawa za su hallaka Yeriko.

The Israelites had to cross the Jordan River to enter into the Promised Land. God told Joshua, "Have the priests go first." When the priests started to step into the Jordan River, the water upstream stopped flowing so the Israelites could cross over to the other side of the river on dry ground.

Sai da Isra'ilawa suka ratsa kogin Urdun, suka shiga ƙasar alkawali. Allah ya cewa Joshuwa:" Firist su shiga gaba". Da firistoci suka sa ƙafafu cikin kogin Urdun, sai ruwan ya tsaya da hucewa, Isra'ilawa suka ƙetara zuwa gehen bisan busashiyar ƙasa.

After the people crossed the Jordan River, God told Joshua how to attack the powerful city of Jericho. The people obeyed God. Just as God told them to do, the soldiers and priests marched around the city of Jericho once a day for six days.

Bayan da mutanen suka ratsa kogin Urdun, Allah ya gayawa Joshuwa yadda za su yaƙi garin Yeriko. Mutanen su ka yi wa Allah biyyaya. Kamar yadda Allah ya faɗa masu, sojojin da firistoci suka kewaye garin Yeriko sau guda kowace rana har kwana shidda.

Then on the seventh day, the Israelites marched around the city seven more times. While they marched around the city for the last time, the soldiers shouted while the priests blew their trumpets.

Sai a kwana na bakwai, Isra'ilawa suka kewaye garin sau bakwai. Da suka kewaye garin kari na ƙarshe, sojojin suka yi ƙara, firistocin suka busa ƙafonni.

Then the walls around Jericho fell down! The Israelites destroyed everything in the city as God had commanded. They only spared Rahab and her family, who became part of the Israelites. When the other people living in Canaan heard that the Israelites had destroyed Jericho, they were terrified that the Israelites would attack them also.

Sai garunan kewaye da Yeriko suka faɗi! Isra'ilawa suka hallaka komi cikin garin kamar yadda Allah ya umurce su. Sun ceci Rahab da iyalinta, sai suka zama cikin isra'ilawa. Da sauran mutanen Kan'ana suka ji Isra'ilawa sun hallaka Yeriko, suka tsorota suma Isra'ilawa za su faɗa masu.

God had commanded the Israelites not to make a peace treaty with any of the people groups in Canaan. But one of the Canaanite people groups, called the Gibeonites, lied to Joshua and said they were from a place far from Canaan. They asked Joshua to make a peace treaty with them. Joshua and the Israelites did not ask God where the Gibeonites were from. So Joshua made a peace treaty with them.

Allah ya umurci Isra'ilawa kadda su yi sulhu da kowace kabila cikin Kan'ana. Amma ɗaya daga cikin kabilar kan'ana da ake kira gibenawa suka yi ƙarya, suka cewa Joshuwa su ba na Kan'ana bane. Suka tambayi Joshuwa yayi sulhu da su. Joshuwa da Isra'ilawa ba su tambayi Allah ba daga ina Gibenawan suka fito. Sai Joshuwa ya sasanta da su.

The Israelites were angry when they found out that the Gibeonites had deceived them, but they kept the peace treaty they had made with them because it was a promise before God. Sometime later, the kings of another people group in Canaan, the Amorites, heard that the Gibeonites had made a peace treaty with the Israelites, so they combined their armies into one large army and attacked Gibeon. The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua asking for help.

Isra'ilawa sun husata da suka gane da cewa Gibenawa sun ruɗe su, amma sun riƙe alkawalin sulhun da suka masu domin alkawali ne a gaban Allah. Wata rana, sarakunan wata kabilar Kan'ana, Amorawa, suka ji labari Gibenawa sun yi sulhu da Isra'ilawa, sai suka haɗu cikin rundunar sojoji su yaƙi Gibewon. Gibenawa suka aike da saƙo wurin Joshuwa neman taimako.

So Joshua gathered the Israelite army and they marched all night to reach the Gibeonites. In the early morning they surprised the Amorite armies and attacked them.

Sai Joshuwa ya tattara rundunan sojojin Isra'ila, suka kuma yi tafiya dukan dare don su isko Gibenawa. Da asuba sun shammaci sojojin Amorawa sun fɗa masu da yaƙi.

God fought for Israel that day. He caused the Amorites to be confused and he sent large hailstones that killed many of the Amorites.

Allah ya yi yaƙi domin Isra'ila wannan rana. Ya ɓikita Amorawa, ya kuma aike da manyan duwatsuna da suka kashe mafi yawa daga Amorawan.

God also caused the sun to stay in one place in the sky so that Israel would have enough time to completely defeat the Amorites. On that day, God won a great victory for Israel.

Allah ya kuma sa rana ta tsaya wuri guda cikin sama don Isra'ilawa su samu lokaci issashe cin yaƙin Amorawa. A wannan rana, Allah ya ci babbar nasara domin Isra'ila.

After God defeated those armies, many of the other Canaanite people groups gathered together to attack Israel. Joshua and the Israelites attacked and destroyed them.

Bayan da Allah ya ci waɗannan rundunan sojojin da yaƙi, dayawa daga sauran kabilun Kan'ana suka haɗu tare don su yaƙi Isra'ila. Joshuwa da Isra'ilawa suka faɗa su, suka hallaka su.

After this battle, God gave each tribe of Israel its own section of the Promised Land. Then God gave Israel peace along all its borders.

Byan wannan yaƙin, Allah ya baiwa kowace kabila ta Isra'ila yankin ƙasa a ƙasar alkawali. Sai Allah ya baiwa Isra'ila kwanciyar hankali bisan dukan iyakansu.

When Joshua was an old man, he called all the people of Israel together. Then Joshua reminded the people of their obligation to obey the covenant that God had made with the Israelites at Sinai. The people promised to remain faithful to God and follow his laws.

//Da Joshuwa ya tsufa, ya kira dukan mutanen Isra'ila gaba ɗaya. Sai Joshuwa ya tunawa mutanen jawabinsu ne su yi biyyaya da alkawalin da Allah ya ɗauka da su a Sinai. Mutanen suka ɗauki alkawalin manne wa Allah da dokokinsa.//
