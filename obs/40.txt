After the soldiers mocked Jesus, they led him away to crucify him. They made him carry the cross on which he would die.

Bayan da sojojin suka yi ma Yesu ba'a, sai suka kai shi wani wuri suka giciye shi. Suka sa ya ɗauki giciyen bisan wanda zai mutu.

The soldiers brought Jesus to a place called "the Skull" and nailed his hands and feet to the cross. But Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing." Pilate commanded that they write, "King of the Jews" on a sign and put it on the cross above Jesus' head.

Sojojin suka kai Yesu wani wuri da ake kira Golgota, kuma suka kafa masa ƙusoshi a hannuwa da ƙafafuwa a jikin giciyen. Amma Yesu ya ce:" Uba, ka gafarta masu, gama ba su san abin da suke yi ba". Bilatus ya umurce su, su rubuta:" Sarkin Yahudawa" bisan wata alama, kuma su ɗaura shi kan giciye sama da kan Yesu.

The soldiers gambled for Jesus' clothing. When they did this, they fulfilled a prophecy that said, "They divided my garments among them, and gambled for my clothing."

Sojojin suka jefa kuri'a a kan kayan Yesu. Da suka yi hakanan, sun cika annabci da ya ce:" Sun raba kayana a tsakaninsu, kuma sun jefa kuri'a a kan tufafina".

Jesus was crucified between two robbers. One of them mocked Jesus, but the other said, "Do you have no fear of God? We are guilty, but this man is innocent." Then he said to Jesus, "Please remember me in your kingdom." Jesus answered him, "Today, you will be with me in Paradise."

Yesu an giciye shi a tsakanin ɓarayi biyu. Ɗaya daga cikinsu ya yi wa Yesu ba'a, amma ɗayan ya ce:" Ba ka da tsoron Allah? Mun yi laifi, amma wannan mutumen maras laifi ne". Sai ya cewa Yesu:" In ka yarda ka tuna da ni a cikin mulkinka". Yesu ya amsa masa cewa:" Yau, za ka zauna tare da ni a cikin Aljanna".

The Jewish leaders and the other people in the crowd mocked Jesus. They said to him, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross and save yourself! Then we will believe you."

Shugabannin Yahudawa da sauran mutane cikin taron suka yi wa Yesu ba'a. Suka ce masa:" In kai Ɗan Allah ne, sauko daga giciyen, kuma ka ceci kanka! sa'anan sai mu bada gaskiya gareka".

Then the sky over the whole region became completely dark, even though it was the middle of the day. It stayed dark from noon until 3:00 in the afternoon.

Da samaniya bisan dukan wurin ta yi baƙi gaba ɗaya, ko da yake cikin tsakiyar rana ne, sai duhu ya tsaya har zuwa ƙarfe uku na maraice.

Then Jesus cried out, "It is finished! Father, I give my spirit into your hands." Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. When he died, there was an earthquake and the large curtain that separated the people from the presence of God in the Temple was torn in two, from the top to the bottom.

Sai Yesu ya ɗaga murya:" An ƙare! Uba, ina sakin ruhuna a hannuwanka". Sai ya sadda kai, kuma ya bar ruhunsa. Da ya mutu, sai aka yi girgizar ƙasa, kuma sai labulen da yake raba mutane daga hallarar Allah ya rabu a biyu daga sama zuwa ƙasa.

Through his death, Jesus opened a way for people to come to God. When the soldier guarding Jesus saw everything that had happened, he said, "Certainly, this man was innocent. He was the Son of God."

Ta wurin mutuwarsa, Yesu ya buɗe wa mutane hanyar zuwa wurin Allah. Da sojin da yake gadi ya ga duk abin da ya faru, ya ce:" Na tabbata wannan mutum maras laifi ne. Shi Ɗan Allah ne".

Then Joseph and Nicodemus, two Jewish leaders who believed Jesus was the Messiah, asked Pilate for Jesus' body. They wrapped his body in cloth and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then they rolled a large stone in front of the tomb to block the opening.

//Sai Yusufu da Nicodemus, shugabannin Yahudawa biyu da suka gaskanta da Yesu Almasihu ne, suka tambayi Bilatus jikin Yesu. Suka nanaɗe jikin cikin zane, kuma suka sa shi cikin kushewa da aka gina cikin dutse. Sai suka gangaro da babban dutse a gaban kushewar suka rufe ƙofar.//
