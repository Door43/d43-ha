One day, Jesus and his disciples went in a boat across the lake to the region where the Gerasene people lived.

Wata rana, Yesu da almajiransa suka shiga jirgin ruwa suka tsallaka kogi zuwa wata ƙasa inda garasinawa suke.

When they reached the other side of the lake, a demon-possessed man came running up to Jesus

Da suka kai wancan gefen kogin, wani mutum mai aljannu ya zo da gudu wurin Yesu.

This man was so strong that nobody could control him. People had even fastened his arms and legs with chains, but he kept breaking them.

Wannan mutum yana da ƙarfi sosai har da ba wanda ya iya riƙe shi. Mutane har sun ɗaure hannuwansa da ƙafafuwansa da igiyoyin ƙarfe, amma ya ci gaba da karyasu.

The man lived among the tombs in the area. This man would scream all day and all night. He did not wear clothes and cut himself repeatedly with stones.

Mutumen ya zaune a bakin kushewu. Wannan mutum ya kan yi ƙara dukan rana da dukan dare. Ba shi da sutura, kuma yana ta yanke kanshi da duwatsu.

When the man came to Jesus, he fell on his knees in front of him. Jesus said to the demon, "Come out of this man!"

Da mutumen ya zo wurin Yesu, ya faɗi a gwiwowinsa a gaban shi. Yesu ya cewa aljannin:" Fito daga mutumen nan!"

The man with the demon cried out in a loud voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please do not torture me!" Then Jesus asked the demon, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion, because we are many." (A "legion" was a group of several thousand soldiers in the Roman army.)

Mutumen mai aljannin ya yi ƙara da murya mai ƙarfi:" Me ka ke so da ni Yesu, Ɗan Allah Maɗaukaki? Don Allah kar ka wahalshe ni!" Sai Yesu ya tambayi aljannin:" Mene sunanka?" Ya amsa:" Sunana Dubu, domin mu dayawa ne".( Dubu ƙangin dubu da dubunnai sojojin Ramawa ne.)

The demons begged Jesus, "Please do not send us out of this region!" There was a herd of pigs feeding on a nearby hill. So, the demons begged Jesus, "Please send us into the pigs instead!" Jesus said, "Go!"

Aljannun suka roƙi Yesu:" Don Allah kadda ka kore mu nesa da nan!" Akwai garken aladu suna kiwo a kusan wurin. Sai aljannun suka riƙi Yesu:" Don Allah aika mu cikin aladun kanbacin!" Yesu ya ce:" Ku tafi!"

The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs. The pigs ran down a steep bank into the lake and drowned. There were about 2,000 pigs in the herd.

Aljannun suka fita daga mutumen, kuma suka shiga aladun. Aladun suka gudu cikin kogi suka nutse. Akwai kusan aladu 2,000 cikin garken.

When the people who took care of the pigs saw what happened, they ran into the town and told everyone that they met what Jesus had done. The people from the town came and saw the man who used to have the demons. He was sitting calmly, wearing clothes, and acting like a normal person.

Da makiyayan aladun suka ga abin da ya faru, sun yi gudu cikin gari, kuma suka shaidawa kowa da sun sadu da Yesu da abin da ya yi. Mutanen garin suka zo suka ga mutumen mai aljannun yana zaune hankali kwance, yana saye da kayan jiki, kuma ya zama mutum mai hankali.

The people were very afraid and asked Jesus to leave. So Jesus got into the boat and prepared to leave. The man who used to have the demons begged to go along with Jesus.

Mutanen sun tsorota, kuma suka ambaci Yesu ya bar garin. Sai Yesu ya shiga jirgin ruwa, kuma ya yi shirin tafiya. Mutumen mai aljannun a da, ya roƙi Yesu ya raƙa shi.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-11.jpg?direct&}}

But Jesus said to him, "No, I want you to go home and tell your friends and family about everything that God has done for you and how he has had mercy on you."

Amma Yesu ya ce masa:" Aa, so nake ka je gida ka shaidawa abokai da iyalinka abin da Allah ya yi maka, kuma ta ƙaƙa ya ji tausayinka".

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-12.jpg?direct&}}

So the man went away and told everyone about what Jesus had done for him. Everyone who heard his story was filled with wonder and amazement.

Sai mutumen ya tafi, kuma ya shaidawa kowa abin da Yesu ya yi masa. Dukan wanda ya ji labarin ya cika da mamaki da murna.

Jesus returned to the other side of the lake. After he arrived there, a large crowd gathered around him and pressed in on him. In the crowd was a woman who had suffered from a bleeding problem for twelve years. She had paid all of her money to doctors so they would heal her, but she only got worse.

Yesu ya koma wancan gefen kogi. Bayan da ya isa can, taro mai yawa ya kewaye shi ya matse shi kusa-kusa. Cikin taron akwai wata mace da take fama da ciwon zubda jini har tsawon shekara goma sha biyu. Ta kashe dukan kuɗinta wurin likitoci don su warkas da ita, amma sai ta ƙara lalacewa.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-14.jpg?direct&}}

She had heard that Jesus had healed many sick people and thought, "I'm sure that if I can just touch Jesus' clothes, then I will be healed, too!" So she came up behind Jesus and touched his clothes. As soon as she touched them, the bleeding stopped!

Ta ji labari Yesu ya warkas da marasa lafiya dayawa, kuma ta yi tunani:" Na tabbata in na iya taɓa kayan jikin Yesu kaɗai ma, ina iya warkewa ni ma!" Sai ta matso kusa da bayan Yesu, kuma ta taɓa kayanshi. Da ta taɓa su, sai jinin ya tsaya!

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-15.jpg?direct&}}

Immediately, Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. So he turned around and asked, "Who touched me?" The disciples replied, "There are many people crowding around you and bumping into you. Why did you ask, 'Who touched me?'"

Nan da nan, Yesu ya ji a jikinshi da wani iko ya fita daga gareshi. Sai ya juya, kuma ya tambaya:" Wa ya taɓa ni?" Almajiran suka amsa masa:" Akwai mutane dayawa kewaye da kai, kuma suna faɗa maka. Ƙaƙa za ka tambaya:" Wa ya taɓa ni?"

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-32-16.jpg?direct&}}

The woman fell on her knees before Jesus, shaking and very afraid. Then she told him what she had done, and that she had been healed. Jesus said to her, "Your faith has healed you. Go in peace."

//Macen ta faɗin a gabansa a gwiwawunta, tana rawar jiki, kuma ta tsorota. Sai ta gaya masa abin da ta yi, kuma ta sami lafiya. Yesu ya ce mata:" Bangaskiyarki ta warkasda ke. Je ki cikin salama".//
