After Jesus returned to heaven, the disciples stayed in Jerusalem as Jesus had commanded them to do. The believers there constantly gathered together to pray.

Bayan da Yesu ya koma sama, almajiran suka tsaya a Urshalima kamar yadda Yesu ya umurce su. Masu bi a can suka riƙa taruwa tare domin addu'a.

Every year, 50 days after the Passover, the Jews celebrated an important day called Pentecost. Pentecost was a time when the Jews celebrated the harvest. Jews came from all over the world to Jerusalem to celebrate Pentecost together. This year, the time for Pentecost came about a week after Jesus had gone back to heaven.

Kowace shekara, kwana hamsin bayan idin ƙetarewa, Yahudawa suna yin wata babbar sallah da ake kira Fentikos. Fentikos lokacine da Yahudawa suke idin girbi. Yahudawa suka zo daga ko'ina cikin duniya domin su yi Fentikos tare. Wannan shekara, lokacin Fentikos ya zo daidai da sati guda bayan da Yesu ya koma sama.

While the believers were all together, suddenly the house where they were was filled with a sound like a strong wind. Then something that looked like flames of fire appeared over the heads of all the believers. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they began to speak in other languages.

Sa'adda masu bi suke tare, ba zato ba tsammani, gidan da suke ciki ya cika da ƙara kamar na iska mai ƙarfi. Sai wani abu kamar harsunan wuta suka bayyana bisan kanun dukan masu bi. Duka suka cika da Ruhu Mai Tsarki, kuma suka fara magana da waɗansu harsuna.

When the people in Jerusalem heard the noise, a crowd came to see what was happening. When the people heard the believers proclaiming the wonderful works of God, they were astonished that they were hearing these things in their own native languages.

Da mutanen Urshalima suka ji muryoyin, taron jama'a ya zo ya gani mai ke faruwa. Da mutanen suka ji masu bin suna shelar al'ajabai ayukan da Allah ya yi, sai suka yi mamakin abin da ya faru, suna jin maganganun kowane cikin harshensu.

Some of the people accused the disciples of being drunk. But Peter stood up and said to them, "Listen to me! These people are not drunk! This fulfills the prophecy made by the prophet Joel in which God said, 'In the last days, I will pour out my Spirit.'"

Waɗansu mutanen suka zargi almajiran cewa da sun bugu da giya. Amma Bitrus ya tashi ya ce masu:" Ku saurare ni! Wannan mutane ba su yi maye ba! Wannan ya cika annabci da annabi Joel ya yi cikin wanda Allah ya ce:" Cikin kwanakin ƙarshe, zan zubo da Ruhuna".

"Men of Israel, Jesus was a man who did many mighty signs and wonders by the power of God, as you have seen and already know. But you crucified him!"

" Mutanen Isra'ila, Yesu mutum ne wanda ya yi babbar shaida, kuma ya yi al'ajabai dayawa da ikon Allah, kamar yadda ku ka gani, kuma kun riga kun sani. Amma ku ka giciye shi!"

"Although Jesus died, God raised him from the dead. This fulfills the prophecy which says, 'You will not let your Holy One rot in the grave.' We are witnesses to the fact that God raised Jesus to life again."

" Ko da yake Yesu ya mutu, Allah ya tashe shi daga mattatu. Wannan ya cika annabcin da ya ce:" Ba za ka bar mai Tsarkin ka  ya ruɓe  a cikin kabari ba". " Mu shaidu ne cewa Allah ya tada Yesu zuwa rai kuma".

"Jesus is now exalted to the right hand of God the Father. And Jesus has sent the Holy Spirit just as he promised he would do. The Holy Spirit is causing the things that you are now seeing and hearing."

" Yesu yanzu ya kimantu a hannun dama na Allah Uba. Sai Yesu ya aike da Ruhu Mai Tsarki kamar yadda ya yi alkawali zai yi. Ruhu Mai Tsarkin ne yake sawa dukan ayukan da ku ka gani ko ji, su faru.

"You crucified this man, Jesus. But know for certain that God has caused Jesus to become both Lord and Messiah!"

" Kun giciye wannan mutumen, Yesu. Amma ku sani da cewa hakika Allah ne ya sa Yesu ya zama Ubangiji da Almasihu!"

The people listening to Peter were deeply moved by the things that he said. So they asked Peter and the disciples, "Brothers, what should we do?"

Mutanen da suke sauraron Bitrus sun taɓu sosai da abin da ya ce. Sai suka tambayi Bitrus da almajiran:" ƴan'uwa, me ya kamata mu yi?"

Peter answered them, "Every one of you should repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so that God will forgive your sins. Then he will also give you the gift of the Holy Spirit."

Bitrus ya amsa masu:" Kowanen ku sai ya tuba, kuma a yi masa baftisma cikin sunan Yesu Kristi domin Allah ya gafarta zunubinku. Kuma zai kuwa ba ku kyautar Ruhu Mai Tsarki".

About 3,000 people believed what Peter said and became disciples of Jesus. They were baptized and became part of the church at Jerusalem.

Kusan mutane 3,000 suka bada gaskiya ga faɗawar Bitrus, kuma suka zama almajiran Yesu. Aka yi masu baftisma, sai suka zama membobin Ekklizia a Urshalima.

The disciples continually listened to the teaching of the apostles, spent time together, ate together, and prayed with each other. They enjoyed praising God together and they shared everything they had with each other. Everyone thought well of them. Every day, more people became believers.

//A Bible story from: Acts 2//

//Almajiran suka ci gaba da sauraron koyaswar manzannai, suka ci lokaci tare, suka ci abinci tare, kuma suka yi wa juna addu'a. Suka yi murnar yabon Allah tare, kuma suka raraba kominsu tsakanin juna. Kowa ya yaba masu. Kowace rana mutane masu bi suka yi ta ƙaruwa.//
