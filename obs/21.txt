From the very beginning, God planned to send the Messiah. The first promise of the Messiah came to Adam and Eve. God promised that a descendant of Eve would be born who would crush the snake's head. The snake who deceived Eve was Satan. The promise meant that the Messiah would defeat Satan completely.

Tun da farko, Allah ya nufi ya aiko da Almasihu. Alkawali na fari na zuawan Almasihu ya zo ga Adamu da Hawa'u. Allah ya yi alkawalin cewa da wani daga zuriyar Hawa'u za a haife shi, zai kuje kan maciji. Macijin da ya yaudari Hawa'u Shaitan ne. Alkawalin yana nufin Almasihu zai ci nasara da shaitan cikaka.

God promised Abraham that through him all people groups of the world would receive a blessing. This blessing would be fulfilled when the Messiah would come sometime in the future. He would make it possible for people from every people groups in the world to be saved.

God promised Moses that in the future he would raise up another prophet like Moses. This was another promise about the Messiah who would come at some later time.

God promised King David that one of his own descendants would rule as king over God’s people forever. That meant that the Messiah would be one of David's own descendants.

Through the prophet Jeremiah, God promised that he would make a New Covenant, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. In the New Covenant, God would write his law on the people's hearts, the people would know God personally, they would be his people, and God would forgive their sins. The Messiah would start the New Covenant.

Ta wurin annabi Irmiya, Allah ya faɗa cewa zai yi Sabon alkawali, amma ba kamar alkawalin da Allah ya yi ba da Isra'ila a Sinai. Cikin sabon alkawalin, Allah zai rubuta dokarsa cikin zuciyar mutane, mutane za su san Allah da kansu, za su zama mutanensa, kuma Allah zai gafarta zunubainsu. Almasihu zai fara Sabon Alkawali.

God's prophets also said that the Messiah would be a prophet, a priest, and a king. A prophet is a person who hears the words of God and then proclaims God's words to the people. The Messiah that God promised to send would be the perfect prophet.

Annabawan Allah kuma suka ce Almasihu zai zama annabi, firist da kuma sarki.Annabi mutum ne mai jin maganar Allah, kuma yana furta maganar Allah ga mutane. Almasihun da Allah ya alkawarta ya aiko zai zama cikaken annabi.

Israelite priests made sacrifices to God on behalf of the people as a substitute for the punishment for their sins. Priests also prayed to God for the people. The Messiah would be the perfect high priest who would offer himself as a perfect sacrifice to God.

Firistocin Isra'ilawa suka miƙa hadayu ga Allah da sunan mutane a maimakon horon don zunubainsu. Firistoci hallo suka yi addu'a ga Allah domin mutane. Almasihu zai zama cikaken babban firist da zai bada kan shi sadaka, kyaukyawar hadaya ga Allah.

A king is someone who rules over a kingdom and judges the people. The Messiah would be the perfect king who would sit on the throne of his ancestor David. He would reign over the whole world forever, and would always judge honestly and make the right decisions.

Sarki mutum ne mai mulki bisan daula, kuma yana shar'anta mutane. Almasihu zai zama cikaken sarki da zai zauna a gadon sarauta na kakan shi Dauda. Zai yi mulki bisan dukan duniya har abada, kuma zai yi shari'a da gaske, kuma ya ɗauki shawarorin da suke daidai.

God's prophets predicted many other things about the Messiah. The prophet Malachi foretold that a great prophet would come before the Messiah came. The prophet Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would be born from a virgin. The prophet Micah said that he would be born in the town of Bethlehem.

Annabawan Allah sun yi annabcin wasu abubuwa da yawa a kan Almasihu. Annabi Malaci ya bada labari cewa da wani babban annabi zai zo kamin Almasihu ya iso. Annabi Ishaya ya yi annabci cewa da Almasihu, za a haife shi ta wurin budurwa. Annabi Mika ya ce da za a haife shi a cikin garin Baitalami.

The prophet Isaiah said the Messiah would live in Galilee, comfort broken-hearted people, and proclaim freedom to captives and release to prisoners. He also predicted that the Messiah would heal sick people and those who could not hear, see, speak, or walk.

Annabi Ishaya ya faɗa cewa Almasihu zai rayu a Galili, ya ƙarfafa mutanen da zuciyarsu ta karye, ya furta saki ga ɗauraru da kuma na cikin kaso. Ya kuma yi annabci cewa da Almasihu zai warkar da marassa lafiya da kuma kurame, makafi, baibai ko guragu.

The prophet Isaiah also prophesied that the Messiah would be hated without reason and rejected. Other prophets foretold that those who killed the Messiah would gamble for his clothes and that a friend would betray him. The prophet Zechariah predicted that the friend would be paid thirty silver coins as payment for betraying the Messiah.

Annabi Ishaya hallo ya yi annabci cewa almasihu zai zama abin ƙyama, kuma za a yas da shi ba tare da ya yi wani abu ba. Waɗansu annabawa sun faɗa cewa da waɗanda suka kashe Almasihu za su jefa kuri'a a kan kayan jikinshi, kuma ɗaya daga abokansa zai ci amanarsa.

The prophets also told about how the Messiah would die. Isaiah prophesied that people would spit on, mock, and beat the Messiah. They would pierce him and he would die in great suffering and agony, even though he had not done anything wrong.

Annabawan kuma suka faɗi yadda Almasihu zai mutu. Ishaya ya yi annabci da mutane za su tofa masa yau, su yi masa ba'a, kuma su duke Almasihu. Za su soke shi kuma zai mutu cikin azaba mai zafi da raɗaɗi. ko da yake bai yi kome ba.

The prophets also said that the Messiah would be perfect, having no sin. He would die to receive the punishment for other people's sin. His punishment would bring peace between God and people. For this reason, it was God's will to crush the Messiah.

Annabawa suka ƙara cewa da Almasihu zai zama cikake, maras zunubi. Zai mutun don ya ɗauki horo saboda zunubin sauran mutane. Horon shi zai kawo salama tsakanin Allah da mutane. Sabili da wannan, nufin Allah ne ya murƙushe Almasihu.

The prophets foretold that the Messiah would die and that God would also raise him from the dead. Through the Messiah's death and resurrection, God would accomplish his plan to save sinners and start the New Covenant.

Annabawa sun riga faɗa cewa da Almasihu zai mutu, kuma Allah zai tashe shi daga matattu. Ta wurin mutuwa da tashin Almasihu, Allah zai cika tsarinsa na ceton masu zunubi, kuma ya fara Sabon Alkawali.

God revealed to the prophets many things about the Messiah, but the Messiah did not come during the time of any of those prophets. More than 400 years after the last of these prophecies was given, at exactly the right time, God would send the Messiah into the world.
