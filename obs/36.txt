One day, Jesus took three of his disciples, Peter, James, and John with him. (The disciple named John was not the same person who baptized Jesus.) They went up on a high mountain by themselves to pray.

Wata rana, Yesu ya ɗauki uku daga cikin almajiransa, Bitrus, Yakubu da Yahaya tare da shi. ( Almajirin mai sunan Yahaya ba shine ba Yahaya mai baftisma). Suka tafi sama bisan dutsi don su keɓe su yi addu'a.

As Jesus was praying, his face became as bright as the sun and his clothes became as white as light, whiter than anyone on earth could make them.

Sa'adda Yesu yake addu'a, fuskarsa ta zama da haske kamar rana, kuma tufafinsa suka zama farare kamar haske, farare fiye da kowane a duniya yake iyawa.

Then Moses and the prophet Elijah appeared. These men had lived on the earth hundreds of years before this. They talked with Jesus about his death, which would soon happen in Jerusalem.

Sai Musa da annabi Iliya suka bayyana gareshi. Waɗanan mutane sun rayu a duniya shekaru ɗaruruwa da suka wuce. Sun yi magana da Yesu a kan mutuwarsa, da za ta faru ba da daɗewa ba a Urshalima.

As Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus, Peter said to Jesus, "It is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." Peter did not know what he was saying.

Yayin da Musa da Iliya suke magana da Yesu, Bitrus ya ce wa Yesu:" Yana da kyau mu kasance a nan. Bari mu yi runfa uku, ɗaya dominka, ɗaya don Musa, kuma ɗaya domin Iliya". Bitrus bai san abin da yake cewa ba.

As Peter was talking, a bright cloud came down and surrounded them and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son whom I love. I am pleased with him. Listen to him." The three disciples were terrified and fell on the ground.

Sa'adda Bitrus yake magana, hadiri mai hasken gaske ya sauko ya kewaye su, kuma murya daga sama ta ce:" Wannan ɗana ne ƙaunatace. Ina farin ciki da shi. Ku saurare ni". Almajiran uku suka firgita, suka faɗi a ƙasa.

Then Jesus touched them and said, "Do not be afraid. Get up." When they looked around, the only one still there was Jesus.

Sai Yesu ya taɓa su ya ce:" Kadda ku ji tsoro. Ku tashi!" Da suka duba kewaye da su, babu kowa sai Yesu kaɗai.

Jesus and the three disciples went back down the mountain. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not tell anyone yet about what happened here. I will soon die and then come back to life. After that, you may tell people."

//Yesu da almajiran uku suka koma gida daga dutsen. Sai Yesu ya ce masu:" Kadda ku faɗawa kowa abin da ya faru a nan tukuna. Zan mutu ba da daɗewa ba, kuma zan komo rayayye. Bayan wannan, kuna iya faɗawa mutane".//
