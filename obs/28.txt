One day, a rich young ruler came up to Jesus and asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?" Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me 'good'? There is only one who is good, and that is God. But if you want to have eternal life, obey God's laws."

Wata rana, wani mai arziki, saurayi mai mulki, ya zo wurin Yesu, kuma ya tambaye shi:" Malam managarci, me zan yi in sami rai na har abada?" Yesu ya ce masa:" Me ya sa kake kirana managarci? Allah kaɗai ne managarci. Amma in kana so ka samu rai madawami, yi biyyaya da dokokin Allah".

"Which ones do I need to obey?" he asked. Jesus replied, "Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you love yourself."

" Waɗane zan yi biyyaya da su?" ya tambaya. Yesu ya amsa:" Kadda ka yi kisan kai. Kadda ka yi zina. Kadda ka yi sata. Kadda ka yi ƙarya. Ka girmama mahaifinka da mahaifiyarka, kuma ka ƙaunaci maƙwabcinka kamar kanka".

But the young man said, "I have obeyed all these laws ever since I was a boy. What do I still need to do in order to live forever?" Jesus looked at him and loved him.

Amma saurayin ya ce:" Na kiyaye dukan waɗannan dokoki tun ina yaro. Me kuma zan ƙara yi domin in rayu har abada?" Yesu ya dube shi, kuma ya ƙaunace shi.

Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, then go and sell everything you own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."

Yesu ya amsa:" In kana so ka zama cikake, je ka saidan dukan mallakarka, kuma ka ba matalauta kuɗin. Za ka samu ajiya a sama. Kuma sai ka zo ka bi ni.

When the young man heard what Jesus said, he became very sad, because he was very rich and did not want to give away all the things he possessed. He turned and went away from Jesus.

Da saurayin ya ji abin da Yesu ya ce, sai ya cika da baƙin ciki domin yana da arziki sosai, kuma ba ya so ya rabu da duk ,mallakarsa. Sai ya juya baya, ya bar Yesu.

Then Jesus said to his disciples, "It is extremely hard for rich people to enter into the kingdom of God! Yes, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."

Sai Yesu ya fadawa almajiransa:" Zai yi wuya ga mutane masu arziki su shiga mulkin Allah! Haka ne, ya fi sauki ga raƙumi ya bi ta ƙofar allura, da mai arziki ya shiga mulkin Allah".

When the disciples heard what Jesus said, they were shocked and said, "Then who can be saved?"

Da almajiran suka ji maganar Yesu, sun razana, kuma suka ce:" Kenan wa yake iya tsira?"

Jesus looked at the disciples and said, "With people this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible."

Yesu ya dubi almajiran, kuma ya ce:" Ga mutane ba abu mai yiyuwa ba ne, amma ga Allah, komi ya yiyuwa".

Peter said to Jesus, "We have left everything and followed you. What will be our reward?"

Bitrus ya cewa Yesu:" Mun bar komi mun bika. Menene ladanmu?"

Jesus answered, "Everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or property for my sake, will receive 100 times more and will also receive eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first."

//Yesu ya amsa:" Duk wanda ya bar gidajensa,ƴanuwansa maza, ƴanuwansa mata, mahaifinsa, mahaifiyarsa, ƴaƴansa, ko mallakarsa domina, zai samu sakamako kashi 100 fiye da hakanan, kuma zai samu rai madawami. Amma dayawa na fari za su zama na ƙarshe, kuma dayawa na ƙarshe za su zama na fari".//
