The kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah both sinned against God. They broke the covenant that God had made with them at Sinai. God sent his prophets to warn them to repent and worship him again, but they refused to obey.

Mulkin Isra'ila da mulkin Yahuza duka sun yi wa Allah zunubi. Sun karya alkawalin da Allah ya yi masu a Sinai. Allah ya aike da annabawansa su fadakar da su, su tuba, kuma su bauta mashi, amma sun ƙi su yi biyyaya.

So God punished both kingdoms by allowing their enemies to destroy them. The Assyrian Empire, a powerful, cruel nation, destroyed the kingdom of Israel. The Assyrians killed many people in the kingdom of Israel, took away everything of value, and burned much of the country.

Sai Allah ya hori dukan mulkokin ta barin abokan gaba su hallaka su. Daular Asuriya, al'umma mai ƙarfi, da ƙeta, suka hallaka mulkin Isra'ila. Asuriyawan suka kashe mutane da yawa cikin mulkin Isra'ila, suka ɗauke dukan abubuwa masu tamani, suka ƙone yawancin ƙasar.

The Assyrians gathered all the leaders, the rich people, and the people with skills and took them to Assyria. Only the very poor Israelites who had not been killed remained in the kingdom of Israel.

Asuriyawa suka tattara dukan shugabanni, masu arziki, masu anfani, kuma suka tafi da su Asiriya. Matalauta Isra'ilawa, wanda ba a kashe ba kaɗai, suka yi saura a Isra'ila.

Then the Assyrians brought foreigners to live in the land where the kingdom of Israel had been. The foreigners rebuilt the destroyed cities and married the Israelites who were left there. The descendants of the Israelites who married foreigners were called Samaritans.

Sai Asuriyawa suka kawo baƙi su zauna cikin ƙasar Isra'ila ta da. Baƙin suka sake gina garuruwan da aka hallaka, kuma suka auri Isra'ilawan da suka yi saura. Zuriyar Isra'ilawan da suka auri baƙi sunanansu Samariyawa.

The people in the kingdom of Judah saw how God had punished the people of the kingdom of Israel for not believing and obeying him. But they still worshiped idols, including the gods of the Canaanites. God sent prophets to warn them, but they refused to listen.

Mutanen cikin mulkin Yahuza suka ga yadda Allah ya hori mutanen mulkin Isra'ila domin rashin bada gaskiya da rashin biyyaya gareshi. Amma duk da wannan sun ci gaba da bautar gumaka, har da allolin Can'aniyawa. Allah ya aike da annabawa su faɗakar da su, amma sun ƙi su ji.

About 100 years after the Assyrians destroyed the kingdom of Israel, God sent Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Babylonians, to attack the kingdom of Judah. Babylon was a powerful empire. The king of Judah agreed to be Nebuchadnezzar's servant and pay him a lot of money every year.

Wajen shekara 100 bayan da Asuriyawa suka hallaka mulkin Isra'ila, Allah ya aika Nebukadnezzar, sarkin Babila, ya faɗa mulkin Yahuza da yaƙi. Babila babbar daula ce, mai ƙarfi kuma. Sarkin Yahuza ya yarda ya zama bawan Nebukadnezzar, kuma ya biya haraji mai tsada kowace shekara.

But after a few years, the king of Judah rebelled against Babylon. So, the Babylonians came back and attacked the kingdom of Judah. They captured the city of Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple, and took away all the treasures of the city and the Temple.

Amma bayan ƴan shekaru kaɗan, Sarkin Yahuza ya tayaswa Babila. Sai mutanen Babila suka koma, suka faɗa mulkin Yahuza. Suka ci garin Urshalima, suka hallaka Haikalin, kuma suka ɗauke dukan arzikin garin da Haikalin.

To punish the king of Judah for rebelling, Nebuchadnezzar's soldiers killed the king's sons in front of him and then made him blind. After that, they took the king away to die in prison in Babylon.

Domin horon sarkin Yahuza da yin tawaye, sojojin Nebudkanazzer suka kashen ƴaƴan sakin a gaban idonsa, kuma suka makauta shi. Bayan wannan, sai suka kai sarkin kurkuku, ya mutu a Babila.

Nebuchadnezzar and his army took almost all of the people of the kingdom of Judah to Babylon, leaving only the poorest people behind to plant the fields. This period of time when God's people were forced to leave the Promised Land is called the Exile.

Nebukadnezzar da rundunar sojojinsa suka kai yawancin mutanen mulkin Yahuza zuwa Babila, sai suka bar matalauta a baya su shubka gonaki. Wannan lokacin da mutanen Allah aka fitar da su da ƙarfi daga ƙasar alkawali ana kiranshi Gudun Hijira.

Even though God punished his people for their sin by taking them away into exile, he did not forget them or his promises. God continued to watch over his people and speak to them through his prophets. He promised that, after seventy years, they would return to the Promised Land again.

Ko da yake Allah ya hori mutanensa don zunubinsu ta wurin kai su gudun hijira, bai manta da su ba, ko alkawalainsa. Allah ya ci gaba da lura da su, kuma da magana da su ta wurin annabawa. Ya yi alkawali da cewa bayan shekara saba'in, za su koma ƙasar alkawali.

About seventy years later, Cyrus, the king of the Persians, defeated Babylon, so the Persian Empire replaced the Babylonian Empire. The Israelites were now called Jews and most of them had lived their whole lives in Babylon. Only a few very old Jews even remembered the land of Judah.

Da shekara saba'in suka cika, Sirius, sarkin Persiya ya ci Babila da yaƙi, sai Daular Persiya suka yi kanbacin Daular Babila. Isra;ilawa yanzu ana kiransu yahudawa, kuma yawancin su sun zauna a Babila. Yahudawa ƙalilan ne, kuma tsofofi  ne ƙadai suke tune da ƙasar Yahuza.

The Persian Empire was strong but merciful to the people it conquered. Shortly after Cyrus became king of the Persians, he gave an order that any Jew who wanted to return to Judah could leave Persia and go back to Judah. He even gave them money to rebuild the Temple! So, after seventy years in exile, a small group of Jews returned to the city of Jerusalem in Judah.

Daular Persiya tana ƙarfi amma kuma da juyayin mutanen da suka kamo. Lokaci kaɗan bayan da Siriyu ya zama sarkin persiyawa, ya bada umurni cewa duk ba yahude da yake so ya koma Yahuza, yana iya barin Persiya ya koma Yahuza. Ya kuma bada kuɗin sake gina Haikalin! Kenan bayan shakara saba'in na gudun hijira, wasu yahudawa suka koma garin Urshalima cikin Yahuza.

When the people arrived in Jerusalem, they rebuilt the Temple and the wall around the city. Although they were still ruled by other people, once again they lived in the Promised Land and worshiped at the Temple.

//A Bible story from: 2 Kings 17; 24-25; 2 Chronicles 36; Ezra 1-10; Nehemiah 1-13//

//Da mutanen suka iso Urshalima, suka sake gina Haikalin da kuma garun garin. Duk da wannan waɗansu mutane ne suke mulkinsu. Hallo kuma suna zaune a ƙasar alkawali, kuma suna sujada a Haikalin.//
